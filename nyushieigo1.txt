Professor: Good morning. I'm sure everyone did the homework reading, so I want to begin today's
class on intercultural communication. My first question is "Why do we need to study
intercultural communication?" Would anyone like to answer?
Student 1: Yes, I'll try to answer that. People may think the way they do things or the way they view
the world is "natural" and "correct." When they encounter someone doing things
differently, they regard it as "strange" or "wrong." Having an awareness of intercultural
communication can help us understand and deal with misunderstandings when they arise. I
think it is especially important these days because people travel overseas for many reasons,
such as work, study, or vacations. The opportunities to meet people from other countries
have increased greatly. With this increased contact, there are more chances for trouble
between people from different cultures.
Professor: Right. As you said, studying intercultural communication is useful because I 32 I.
c intercultural knowledge encourages people to study in a foreign country
(D some ways of living are considered to be more correct than others
(D there were many more cases of intercultural communication in the past
c we can cope with cultural misunderstandings more easily and smoothly
Professor: Let's move on to the concept of "culture." You should know that because culture is all
around us all the time, it is difficult to define. Therefore, we tend to discuss culture in
terms of characteristics. Can anyone give an example of a cultural characteristic?
Student 2: The characteristic I found interesting is that people belonging to a culture have the same
values, beliefs, and behaviors. Values are things that are felt to be of worth, like the
Japanese concept of "mottainai." Beliefs are things that people believe to be true, and
these cover a wide variety of areas. For example, people in a culture might share beliefs
about the kinds of foods that are unacceptable. Behavior is about people's actions, and
people in the same culture can often be seen behaving similarly.
Professor: That's a good explanation. That means I 33 I.
c having the same beliefs as other cultural groups is important
<D people from the same cultural group usually behave differently
(3) people's attitudes to food determine which cultures they are from
@ shared behaviors may make you a member of a cultural group
Student 3: Can I ask a question?
Professor: Of course.
Student 3: What about people who always seem to be different from those around them? Sometimes I
don't do things in the same way as my friends. So, if we need to have the same behavior
for group membership, does that mean those who are not the same aren't members of their
cultural group?
Professor: That's a good question. To answer it we need to think in terms of cultural norms rather
than individual examples.
Student 3: What is a cultural norm?
Professor: Well, a cultural norm is a rule or standard of behavior shared by members of a cultural
group.
Student 3: Then what happens to the people who do not follow the cultural norms?
Professor: Well, they may belong to a smaller group, or a sub-cultural group, but that group is still
considered to be part of the culture. This is true as long as their actions are within the
ISXtt 2017

acceptable limits of behavior for that particular culture.
Student 3: So, am I right in thinking that I 34 I?
c a culture contains groups that make up one larger group
(2) acting differently isn't allowed for group membership
c it is important to be in the group that follows the cultural norms
@ the number of sub-cultural groups should be limited
Professor: Yes. I hope this has cleared things up for you. OK. I think we're ready to move on and
think about another characteristic of culture.

US consumers have benefited from an increased volume and variety of fresh-fruit imports,
particularly since the 1990s. The fruit and vegetable section in today's grocery store often has dozens
of different fresh fruits on display all year around, which come from all corners of the globe as
additions to domestic fresh fruit.
The rapid growth of fresh-fruit imports has affected many aspects of the US fresh-fruit market. For
example, while oranges are the US's leading domestically grown fruit, the volume of US orange
imports has grown steadily since the 1990s, with occasional sudden increases when the US crop
experienced freezing weather (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. US fresh-orange imports by country.

The US domestic market receives orange imports from various countries and regions. Among the
major suppliers, Mexico is a longtime source. However, due to the strong US demand for fresh
oranges throughout the year, the Southern Hemisphere countries have also become major suppliers,
especially during the summer months when domestic navel oranges are not available. Australia was
the first such country, starting in the early 1990s after it obtained permission from the US government
to export its navel oranges there. Australia was followed by South Africa in the late 1990s, and most
recently by Chile as well.
In the US, two main types of oranges are produced domestically: "navel oranges" and "Valencia
oranges." Navel oranges ― virtually without seeds, with flesh that separates easily and is firm rather
than watery ― are the most popular oranges for eating fresh. The navel orange share of US
production of fresh-market oranges was 76 percent during the years 2010-2012. In comparison,
Valencia oranges ― with thin skins, containing occasional seeds, and with juicy and sweet flesh ―
accounted for 24 percent during the same period. As the US's top supplier of fresh-market oranges,
California produced 87 percent of fresh-market navel oranges and more than 81 percent of fresh-
market Valencia oranges.
The main harvest period for domestic fresh-market oranges is from November through May, a time
when California's navel oranges are in season. However, the amount of oranges produced and shipped
domestically falls significantly from June through October. In earlier years, when fresh-orange imports
still accounted for only a small portion of domestic use, Valencia oranges were a popular variety when
navel oranges were out of season. As seen in Figure 2, however, navel orange imports from the
Southern Hemisphere countries have come to dominate the US in the summer season.

Figure 2. Seasonal relationship between imported and domestic oranges (2010-2012 average).

Because of seasonal production patterns, the majority of Mexico's oranges arrive in the US market
from December through June, when US supplies are relatively high. In contrast, the season for
imports from the Southern Hemisphere countries is mainly from July through October, when US
supplies are relatively low. This trend is similar to that seen with many other fruits as well.

"No one thought I would amount to much," Uncle John said, as he stood in the kitchen, showing me
how he put together an award-winning four-course dinner. I had just graduated from university, and this
dinner was his gift to me. It felt great to have a well-known chef cooking for me. On top of this, I was
excited because in a few days he was going to compete in The Big-Time Cook Off, a nationwide TV
cooking contest.
When Uncle John was young, his family lived in the countryside. His mother taught at a local school,
but when John was 10, she had to quit to take care of her elderly mother. Until then, his father had
been kind and had had enough time to play with John and his two younger sisters. But as bills kept
piling up, the family got into trouble. John's father finally had to take a job in a city far away, so he
could only come home on the weekends.
Gradually, because of his busy work schedule, John's father began looking tired whenever he came
home. To tell the truth, he had changed from being good-humored to being in a bad mood all the time.
When he was home, he just wanted to rest. He often scolded John for small things. Wanting to be
accepted by his father, John tried to do his best but never felt he was good enough. Eventually, he
･ EXtt 2017
-13

started avoiding his father. He began hanging out at the shopping mall with friends, sometimes skipping his
classes. Little by little John's grades got worse. His parents and teachers were worried about his future.
One Sunday morning, while John's mom was out taking care of her own mother, his father was
napping in the TV room. John's sisters were hungry, so John started to cook something for them. He
was not sure how to cook, but he did not want to bother his father.
Suddenly, the kitchen door opened, and his father was standing there. "Dad, I'm sorry if I woke you
up. Chelsea and Jessica are hungry, and I was trying to cook them some eggs." His dad looked at him
seriously for a moment. "Eggs? Eggs aren't good for lunch on a beautiful Sunday like today. Let's grill
some steaks in the backyard." "Are you sure? You must be tired." "It's OK. I like cooking. It reminds me
of my college days when I worked part-time as a cook. I'll show you how to prepare delicious steaks."
To John's surprise, his father became energetic when he started cooking. He took John aside and
explained to him in detail that cooking was, in a way, like a science project. "You need to measure the
ingredients precisely and know which items go together. If you master this, you can provide pleasure for
a great many people." John felt close to his father for the first time in a long time. From then on, John spent
more time at home. He started cooking for his family regularly, and then later for his friends at college.
John always felt happy when he cooked, and this happiness spilled over into other areas of his life.
Uncle John worked his way through college with jobs in restaurants, and eventually he became a chef
at a famous restaurant. He really liked the job and worked hard developing his own special techniques.
He was finally able to open his own restaurant serving his unique style of food. He won several awards
and cooked for the rich and famous.
This brings us back to the contest. Uncle John and I were excited about his being selected. Yet, he
shared something really touching with me there in the kitchen. "You know, Mike," Uncle John said,
"I'm thrilled to be able to go on TV as part of The Big-Time Cook Off. But what makes me the happiest
is to stand here with you, one of the people I care about, and talk ― just you and me. It's exactly like
what my dad did for me one fine day in summer, so many years ago. And that made all the difference in
my life."

(1) Opera is an art form that celebrates the human voice at its highest level of expression. No other art
form creates excitement and moves the heart in the way that opera does, especially when performed
by a great singer. Such singers are trained to present some of the greatest and most challenging music
that has ever been composed for the human voice.
(2) Opera is an important part of the Western classical music tradition. It uses music, words, and
actions to bring a dramatic story to life. Opera started in Italy at the end of the 16th century and later
became popular throughout Europe. Over the years, it has responded to various musical and
theatrical developments around the world and continues to do so. In recent decades, much wider
audiences have been introduced to opera through modern recording technology. Some singers have
become celebrities thanks to performing on radio, on television, and in the cinema.
(3) However, in recent years, opera has been facing serious challenges. The causes of some of these are
beyond its control. One current challenge to opera is economic. The current world economic
slowdown has meant that less money is available for cultural institutions and artists. This shortage of
0EJttt2O17£B*^AStlHSjESI 9

14
money raises the broader question of how much should be paid to support opera singers and other
artists. Society seems to accept the large salaries paid to business managers and the multi-million-
dollar contracts given to sports athletes. But what about opera singers? Somehow, people have the
idea that artists can be creative only if they suffer in poverty, but this is unrealistic: If artists, including
opera singers, lack the support they need, valuable talent is wasted.
(4) Not only the shortage of money, but also the way money is managed in the opera world has led to
hardships. Principal singers are generally paid performance fees once they complete a show. They
typically receive nothing during the many weeks of rehearsal before a show starts. To prepare for a
role, they must pay the costs of lessons and coaching sessions. If they become ill or cancel their
performance, they lose their performance fee. The insecurity of this system puts the future of opera at
risk.
(5) Another problem faced by opera is how to meet the demands of audiences who are influenced by
popular entertainment. Pop singers are often judged as much on the basis of how they look as how
they sound. Therefore, opera singers, performing to audiences influenced by this popular culture, are
now expected to be "models who sing." These demands may be unrealistic and possibly harmful.
Opera singers simply cannot make a sound big enough to fill a large theater or concert hall without a
microphone if their body weight is too low. Emphasizing physical appearance over singing ability may
cause audiences to miss out on the human voice at its best.
(6) There are no easy solutions to opera's problems and there are many different opinions about the
value of opera. However, every year many young people register for music courses with hopes and
dreams of developing their talents in this special art form. The fact that opera has survived many
obstacles and continues to attract the rising generation demonstrates that it remains a respected art
form full of value.

El In the past, zoos were places where we saw single animals in small, empty cages. Today zoos are
changing in design; animals have more space, and some live in groups. Many zoos try to put animals in
( 1 ) that is similar to where they live in the wild. Some people who believe in animal rights argue
against having zoos, because they think it is wrong to put animals in cages. I support the idea of having
zoos, because they allow us to see wild animals that we cannot see ^otherwise, and they help
endangered species from becoming extinct.
The first reason for having zoos is that they allow people to see wild animals that they could not see
otherwise. Zoos are the only places for most people who live in cities to see wild animals. Seeing wild
animals on nature documentary programs or in books is not the same thing as seeing animals in ( 3 ).
Zoos educate people about wild animals and teach them to understand and care about them. That is
why there are school trips to the zoo, where the zookeepers tell students about the animals.
Secondly, many endangered species would become extinct if we did not have zoos. Zoos have saved
numerous species from dying out or have helped animals get healthier and returned them to the wild.
( 4 ), zoos have a valuable role to play: they have an educational role and help to preserve certain
species. It is important for animals to be treated well and kept in an environment which is as natural as
possible. Many zoos today are responding to their critics and changing the way they keep animals so
that they can continue their role without harming animals.

Last month, France ― including Paris, the "City of Light" ― grew darker at night as one of the
world's most comprehensive lighting laws went into effect. From 1 a.m. to 7 a.m., shop lights are being
turned off, and lights inside office buildings must be turned off within an hour of employees leaving the
workplace. The lighting on France's building fronts cannot be turned on before sunset. Over the next
two years, rules restricting lights on signs will also go into effect. These rules are designed to cut carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions by 250,000 tons per year, save as much as the annual energy consumption of
750,000 households, and dramatically cut the country's overall energy bill by 200 million Euros.
Despite such benefits, one might well wonder why the French ― and potentially all of us ― should
care much about light pollution in the first place. After all, doesn't light at night make our lives safer
and expand our work and play time? Isn't that more important than saving a bit of money or making a
small cut in CO2 emissions?
France's Environment Ministry took steps because, on the contrary, excessive lighting in major cities
and in many parts of the world threatens our health and the health of the natural environments on which
we rely. In his book, The End of Night, Paul Bogard agrees. Bogard reminds us that, until recently,
efforts to limit our use of light have been made in response to complaints that we have lost our starry
nights. Practical need to see stars in the night sky for navigation and star-gazing scientists' research
exists side by side with the artist's desire to paint the magic of the night sky in artwork or poetry.
Remember that famous painting by the Dutch artist Van Gogh, for instance. How tragic to think we

might have no more "Starry Nights"!
Besides science and art, though, other researchers pay attention to the impacts of light pollution on
our health, warning that disturbing these natural patterns of light and dark, and thus the structures and
functions of natural environments, is having deep impacts on humans, creatures, and even plant life.
Scientists are investigating new ways to provide society with the light it demands for security and
commerce while greatly reducing the flood of light that is increasingly disturbing human health and the
ability of many creatures to function.
Some 30 percent of vertebrates (animals with backbones) and more than 60 percent of invertebrates
(those without) are nocturnal, coming out only at night. Many of the rest are active at dawn and dusk,
the borders of day and night. All life potentially feels the impacts of our exploding use of artificial light,
scientists say.
Every time we humans switch on a light, many animals' age-old patterns of mating, travel, and feeding
are altered, often with no time for species to adjust. On the Caribbean island of Tobago, a 2012 study of
leatherback turtles* ― a species that has been on Earth for 150 million years ― found that artificial light
on the nesting beaches is the biggest threat to survival of newly born turtles. This is a major factor in
declining leatherback turtle populations. Newly born turtles have evolved to follow the reflected light of
the stars and moon from the beach to the ocean. But they now follow the light of hotels and streetlights
instead. As a result they die of lack of water, are eaten by other animals, or get run over by cars.
Every year more and more birds traveling long distances are drawn away from their seasonal courses
by artificial light, then killed by flying into buildings. Other recent studies show that artificial light
disturbs patterns of travel and feeding for bats precisely because many bat species avoid lighted areas.
According to a 2011 study in the journal Science, bats benefit U.S. agriculture by billions of dollars
annually, simply by eating insects.
Of course, "humans are animals as well," explains Steven Lockley of Harvard Medical School's
Division of Sleep Medicine, "and so when light/dark cycles disturb seasonal patterns of trees or breeding
cycles of animals, there's no reason to think it's not doing the same to us." As recently as 1980, humans
were thought to be safe from the effects of artificial light at night. But continuing research has shown
that light at night troubles our sleep and confuses our circadian rhythms, those 24-hour biological
processes that control our body's functions. Technological advances such as LEDs (light-emitting diodes)
can improve our ability to reduce and better control lighting, but these same new lights may actually
make things worse because they contain a "blue-rich" white light that especially disturbs circadian rhythms.
More and more of the light we see at night ― whether on our electronic phones and tablets or in
outdoor lighting ― is rich with the blue wavelengths most disturbing to our body's rhythms. (More than
any other wavelengths, blue light tells our brain that night is over, that morning's blue sky has returned,
and that the day has begun ― the opposite signal that we want to be sending our brain in the middle of
the night.) Studies continue to suggest that the consequences of excessive exposure to light at night
include a risk for weight gain, heart disease, and other serious health problems. Last year, the American
Medical Association called for research into the "risks and benefits of workplace and environmental
exposure to light-at-night," and recommended "new lighting technologies at home and at work that take
into account the body's clock." In fact, researchers are concerned about the impact of some new lighting
technologies. LEDs are praised for being energy-efficient and clearer in color. But most LEDs are
actually brighter than the old lights, further increasing light pollution. In fact, LEDs could worsen the
effects of light pollution on human health and the environment by more than five times.
The problem is worsening as China, India, Brazil, and many other countries become increasingly
wealthy and urbanized. Satellite views of Earth at night show vast areas of the planet glowing white,
with only the world's furthest regions still covered in darkness. Some countries have passed regulations
to reduce light pollution, but most nations and cities still do little to slow down the increasing use of
excessive light
The simple act of shielding (changing the amount and direction of light) helps to control light pollution.
While we seldom use lamps without lamp shades inside our homes, most of our outdoor lighting remains
unshielded, sending light straight into the sky, into our eyes, into our neighbors' bedrooms. Until
recently, consumers had few buying choices, but now some stores offer shielded lighting. Street lighting,
stadium lighting, parking lot and gas station lighting ― all can now be shielded.
But then again, don't we need all this light for safety and security? Light equals safety, and darkness
danger ― right? This common belief alone helps to explain why many gas stations and parking lots are
lit more than ten times as brightly as they were just 20 years ago, and why light pollution continues to
grow at up to 20 percent per year. In fact, the issue of light at night and safety is complex, with little
good evidence to support these common beliefs. For example, ever brighter lights can actually reduce
security, blinding our vision. And anyway, like everyone else, criminals too fear the dark as unsafe,
seeking well-lit areas for their dark acts.

It is far more important to use light effectively than simply to use a lot of light. Explaining France's
new lighting rules, former environment minister Delphine Batho said that the government would like to
"change the culture" to include responsible use of light. This change will be welcome, for what experts
and studies ― not to mention our own eyes ― tell us is that we are using far more light than we need,
and at tremendous cost.

E9 What is communicating, and why do we communicate? According to Rudolph F. Verderber,
author of several books on communication, "communicating" is sharing meaning. The word "sharing" is
of key importance and indicates why communication is basic to human society. People must
communicate ― share meaning ― in order to establish relationships and complete tasks. At least two

-20-
people must interact with each other for sharing to take place. This interaction involves sending,
receiving, and responding to messages, which may be verbal (that is, spoken), or nonverbal (for instance,
nodding your head to show that you are listening to what is being said). ,.When communicating with
others, you have responsibilities both as a speaker and a listener, and the more actively you are able to

is most important,
actually, being an active
listener is just as vital. What does it mean to be an active listener? It means that you focus both
physical and mental energy on what a speaker is saying. Merely sitting passively, hearing but not
consciously attending, seriously limits your ability to absorb and interpret information accurately. Active
listening is the only way to come close to understanding what a speaker is saying; it means paying

Vocal communication in birds is usually divided into two types, songs and calls. Songs are long,
elaborated vocalizations with melodic tones, predominantly produced by male song birds, and mostly
during the breeding season. They often happen spontaneously (i.e., are not triggered by a particular
event in the environment) and have a typical daily rhythm. Calls, on the other hand, are shorter and
simpler sounds that may be produced by both males and females all year round. Calls are often
reactions to changes in the environment and they express a range of different functions, such as alarm,
flight or discovery of a food source. However, calls are also used for individual recognition and are
therefore subject to variation at the same time as they serve as signals.
Birds need to communicate to find a partner, keep away competitors, bring up a family, warn against
predators, inform about food sources and keep contact during migration and other movements. These
functions are fulfilled in different channels: hearing, sight, and touch.
The most striking communicative behaviors in birds are the vocalizations ― and among the
vocalizations, the songs of the song birds are particularly conspicuous. Most songs are performed when
males are looking for partners, and the expression can be interpreted as an announcement like, "Listen, I
am a sparrow and this is my territory. I want to raise a family here so females are welcome but males
should beware." The song in the sparrows and the crowing in the crows are both stimulated by the male
hormone, to attract a female and to defend a territory. The biological value of the vocalization among
crows is shown by the fact that the males that crow the most also have the highest reproduction rate.
Songs are sometimes monologues, but they can also come out in the form of dialogues, with
interaction and alignment between individuals. In species with large song repertoires, males often
engage in what is called matched counter-singing, or song sharing, for example by replying to a
neighbor's song with a similar song, or, if his song is well-known, even by singing the next song in the
sequence, thereby taking over the initiative. To counter the song of a neighbor in this way can be
considered a challenge, and evoke a response of aggression, but it has also been noted to result in social
success in terms of increased chances to attract a mate.
Counter-singing interactions are common between neighbors. To get to know the neighbor and his
song repertoire is a good strategy since it is an advantage to have familiar neighbors and well established
territories, the so called "dear enemy" effect. To know the neighbor's song repertoire gives the male full
control over the interaction and he can choose whether to escalate or de-escalate.
Counter-singing is an example of an interaction between males and it can be used in territorial
disputes. Another kind of cooperative singing, which maybe is more similar to human alignment or
synchronization, is the duets between male and female. One difference between duets and counter-
singing in males is that the duets have a more precise timing, with a fair amount of overlapping between
phrases. "Indeed, while phrases may overlap, the sounds themselves may not do so, the birds fitting
their sounds together so precisely that it is hard to believe that more than one individual is involved"
(Catchpole & Slater 1995:174). Duets are acoustic, but do not have to be vocal, since they can also
involve the drumming of woodpeckers. Their functions are assumed to be pair-bonding, at the same
time as territory-claiming, since they catch a stable relationship and signal to other males to keep away.
Singing duets is most commonly found in the tropics, where the birds do not migrate, but have relatively
constant territories the year round. Other features that are typical of duetting birds are that females also
sing and that there are permanent pair-bonds.
Songs are typical expressions for advertising, mating, and defending territory, which constitute the
reproductive function. However, birds may also communicate about an external event, that is, use the
referential function. In a series of experiments on communication in the domestic fowl it was
demonstrated that they produce calls that convey precise information about predators, as well as about
accessible food resources. For predator warnings, there are different calls for enemy from the ground
and enemy from the air. When these calls were played back to hens in an experimental setting, totally
different effects were found. The reaction to a ground alarm call is to stand up and scan the ground to
detect an enemy, whereas the reaction to an aerial alarm call is to look upwards, crouch down with head

and tail lowered.
To investigate the exact meaning of an alarm, one of the experiments included video images, where
animated sequences of a ground predator (a fox) and an aerial predator (a hawk) were displayed. The
images were placed in different places, at ground level and over the cage with the male chicken (i.e., fox
on the ground and fox in the air and hawk on the ground and hawk in the air). When the predators
were placed at unusual positions, there were fewer calls produced. The hawk elicited mostly aerial calls
no matter where it was placed (even though there were some attempts at ground calls when it was placed
on the ground). The responses to the fox were mixed: while it elicited only ground calls when it was
placed on the ground, there were more aerial calls than ground calls when it was positioned overhead. A
possible explanation for this apparent confusion is that some contextual information was missed in the
ground position, since the image was constructed in such a way as to have a neutral background, and the
chicken probably expects more background information on the ground (e.g., bushes) than from the
silhouettes in the air.
Another call with a referential function is the food call. These calls are produced when food is
discovered, alerting their fellows that there is a food source to be shared. In the domestic fowl, the
response to a food call is a downward movement and ground inspection. The use of food calls is
interesting from many aspects. The fact that the calls are used much more when there is an audience at
hand than when the caller is alone, shows that the calls are not just automated reflexes, but directed
towards a potential listener. There is an audience effect, i.e., the audience influences the behavior. But
why attract others to a food source you can eat all by yourself? One suggestion is that bringing more
birds together diminishes the risk for the caller to be attacked by a predator. However, this explanation
does not fit the results from domestic fowls, since the males are known to call more when there is a
female around than when there is a male. This suggests multifunctionality ― a food call can function as
a courting call in certain contexts.
The studies of audience effects have broadened the scope of communicative functions found in birds.
If not only humans but also animals are able to consider the effects of their communicative behavior, and
help others in defense and finding food, some kind of mutual aid could even be involved, so that they
help others in order to get help when they need it. However, the whole discussion of communicative
functions in animals is flawed by the fact that we don't really know what goes on in the minds of the
individuals, since all we have is their behavior and our interpretations.

E9 Mahatma Gandhi said that the real goal of education is to bring out the best in people. Wherever
we go in the world, we find that educators agree on this as an important goal of education. And when
we speak with school principals or teacher educators, they ( 11 ) say that it is crucial to bring out the
best in teachers. Yet, in spite of this general consensus around the goal of bringing out the best in
others, a lot of confusion seems to exist when it comes to the question of how to do this. Although
almost everyone in education holds the ideal of ( 12 ) others in their growth, people try to do so in
many different ways.
For a long time, many people have thought that the best way to "bring out the best" was to confront
people with what was not going well and then try to help them improve. This is what we call the
deficiency model: you try to "( 13 )" what is weak. This model is strongly intertwined with almost
every aspect of education. Look, for example, at how a teacher assesses her students after completing a
test. Very few teachers write positive remarks in the margin at places where the students have done
well. Or observe an evaluative meeting between a school principal and a teacher that focuses on
assessing the teacher's instructional planning and implementation. ( 14 ), most of the time in such a
meeting is devoted to what could be improved in the teacher's behavior and not to an in-depth analysis
of the teacher's strengths. But there are some positive exceptions. Some school principals have
discovered that professional growth among educators is strongly promoted if the evaluative emphasis is
( 15 ) what goes well and how this can be extended.
The deficiency model in education is grounded in a more general view of human growth that has
influenced our society as a whole, probably as a result of this ( 16 ) view in psychology. During the
twentieth century, psychologists have become better and better at mapping and diagnosing abnormalities
and traumas in people, at searching for causes to be found in people's life histories, and at finding and
prescribing treatments. The idea was that as soon as we know what exactly is the problem with a
person, we then may find a solution and "cure" the person. Martin Seligman, who was the president of
the American Psychology Association around the turn of the twenty-first century, took a ( 17 ) the
deficit orientation that was common among almost all of his psychologist colleagues. Together with
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who is well known for his publications on the concept of flow, Seligman wrote
an often quoted article stating that for too long, psychology had focused on disease, weakness, and the
damage done to people. According to these two influential psychologists, a critical review of the
psychologist literature showed that the deficiency model has not been very effective in enhancing
people's well-being.
Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi emphasized that psychology had insufficiently acknowledged the human
potential. Since the year 2000, Seligman has supported the development of a completely new direction
in psychology, called positive psychology, which focuses on people's strengths as the fundamental basis
for growth. Seligman speaks about nurturing people's psychological capital in order to help them
develop resilience, the capacity to ( 18 ) and to see new opportunities in times of trouble. In the end,
this makes people happier, or, to say it in more scientific terms, it enhances people's well-being.
Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi emphasized that "treatment is not just fixing what is broken; it is
nurturing what is best." Hence, they pointed to the importance of positive traits in individuals, which
they call character strengths, such as creativity, courage, perseverance, kindness, and fairness. Central
issues in positive psychology are ( 19 ), and enhancing resilience and well-being. These seem to be

issues that are also highly relevant for education.
What has become clear through the work of researchers in positive psychology is that we can influence
our own well-being, not by just digging into our problems and trying to "solve" them, but by ( 20 ) our

El As most people no doubt noticed given that they were robbed of an hour of sleep, Sunday marked
the beginning of Daylight Saving Time in the United States, Canada, and several other countries. For
morning people, Daylight Saving is a drag, ( 21 ) them of an hour of tranquil morning light. But for
others, "spring forward" brings with it the promise of long, lazy afternoons and warmer weather.
Like millions of other Americans who have walked heavily through an uncomfortably cold winter, I'm
looking forward to the change of season. But Daylight Saving Time is an annual tradition whose time
has passed. In contemporary society, it's not only unnecessary: it's also wasteful, cruel, and dangerous.
And it's long past time to bid it goodbye.
Daylight Saving has been an official ritual since 1918, when President Woodrow Wilson codified it into
law during the days of World War I. Nowadays, its apparent purpose is to ( 22 ): One more hour of
sunlight in the evening means one less hour of consumption of artificial lighting. In 2005, President
George W. Bush lengthened Daylight Saving Time by a month as part of a sweeping energy bill signed
that year, citing the need to reduce U.S. dependency on foreign oil.
But does Daylight Saving Time actually make much of a difference? Evidence suggests that the answer
is ( 23 ). After the Australian government extended Daylight Saving Time by two months in 2000 in
order to accommodate the Sydney Olympic Games, a study at University of California, Berkeley, showed
that the move failed to reduce electricity demand at all. More recently, a study of homes in Indiana ― a
state that adopted Daylight Saving Time only in 2006 ― showed that the savings from electricity use
were not as great as the additional use of air conditioning and heat.
The simple fact of ( 24 ) to the time change, however subtle, also has measurable consequences.
Many people feel the effects of the "spring forward" for longer than a day; a study showed that
Americans lose around 40 minutes of sleep on the Sunday night after the shift. This means more than
just additional yawns on Monday: the resulting loss in productivity costs the economy an estimated $434
million a year.
Daylight Savings Time may also hurt people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder, robbing
them of light in the mornings. The switchover to Daylight Savings Time is also linked to an increase in
heart attacks as well as traffic accidents.
Those of us who have lived with Daylight Savings Time our whole lives might feel disoriented without
it. But the millions of Americans in Arizona, Hawaii, and territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and the
U.S. Virgin Islands have survived just fine without it. Not to mention the billions of people throughout
Asia, Africa, and South America.
It's said that Benjamin Franklin first proposed a version of Daylight Savings back in 1784 as a way to
save candles. This, no disrespect to old Ben, should tell us how ( 25 ) the tradition has become.
President Obama ― and leaders elsewhere in the world ― should do the sensible thing and scrap it.

Off the coast of Western Australia, three big buoys floating beneath the ocean's surface look like
giant jellyfish tethered to the seafloor. The steel machines, 36 feet wide, are buffeted by the powerful
waves of the Indian Ocean. By harnessing the constant motion of the waves, the buoys generate about
5 percent of the electricity used at a nearby military base on Garden Island. The buoys are a pilot
project of Carnegie Wave Energy, a company based in Perth. In late February, the buoys started
supplying 240 kilowatts each to the electricity grid at Australia's largest naval base. They also help run a
desalination plant that transforms seawater into about one-third of the base's fresh water supply.
Renewable energy is not an urgent matter in Australia, given the country's plentiful supplies of fossil
fuels, particularly coal. But Carnegie's demonstration project is ultimately aimed at island nations that
must import expensive fuel for electricity, as well as military bases looking to ^bolster energy and water
security. "Island nations are all looking to be sustainable," said Michael Ottaviano, chief executive of
Carnegie. Wave energy could be a good fit, especially for islands where tropical clouds impede solar
power or where wind turbines disturb the aesthetics of tourist destinations.
,A1 Given the ocean's power, wave energy seems a promising source of renewable energy. Over the last
two decades, companies have developed various designs, including a snakelike apparatus with hinged
joints from Pelamis Wave Power; a tubelike device from Ocean Power Technologies of New Jersey and
bobbing buoys from AWS Ocean Energy of Scotland. But wave energy remains largely experimental.
The equipment is easily damaged by (f)relentless waves and strong storms. And there is a ^scarcity of
large investments needed to refine and test designs. In a blow to the industry, Pelamis collapsed late last
year after it failed to secure ^adequate financing. "The biggest challenge is funding," said Mr.
Ottaviano. "Any power generation product is capital-intensive. Anytime you want to test an idea, it
costs millions of dollars." "Energy technologies that are mainstream today, like nuclear power, were
developed for commercial use with government research and support," he said.
Carnegie's pilot project, named Ceto 5 after the Greek sea goddess Ceto, began with more than $30
million in financing from investors and the Australian government, including $13.1 million from the
Australian Renewable Energy Agency and $7.3 million from the Low Emissions Energy Development
Program. Carnegie has been working on its Ceto technology since 1999, with cumulative investment of
more than $100 million. To battle the elements that make wave energy so difficult to produce, this
technology differs from most other wave energy designs. Its buoys sit three to six feet underwater,
rather than float on the surface. This helps,. .shield the equipment from pounding waves. Mr. Ottaviano,
who grew up in Perth, near the ocean, said, "m,Everyone knows when you see a wave the intuitive
is to dive underneath."
The constant rocking of the ocean drives hydraulic pumps that push seawater and other liquids
through a pipe to a power plant nearly two miles away on Garden Island. There, the high-pressure water
turns standard hydroelectric turbines, which power a generator. Wave energy from the buoys also
pumps high-pressure water through the desalination plant, without using fossil fuels. In contrast, many
desalination plants use diesel fuel or electricity to pump saltwater at high pressure through membranes
to yield fresh water.
Carnegie is already planning to start using larger, better-designed buoys in 2017 that could each generate
one megawatt of electricity. The new technology, called Ceto 6, would use buoys 65 feet wide that could
produce four times the energy of the current prototype. The new technology would generate electricity
inside the buoy instead of at an onshore power plant. The electricity would be carried to shore by
underwater cables, rather than by pumping water through a pipe. These larger buoys would also sit in
deeper water, more than seven miles from shore, where waves are larger and have more energy. The
newer buoys would be easier to maintain because they would be m self-contained units that could be
towed back to shore. Ceto 5 uses heavy machinery on the sea floor next to each pump to smooth the flow
of the piped water. Because no water is pumped with the newer buoys, this equipment is not needed.
Ceto 6 is expected to generate 30 to 40 percent of the naval base's electricity at a cheaper rate.
Carnegie estimates that using the improved buoys in large wave farms of 100 megawatts would reduce
rates to 12 to 15 cents a kilowatt-hour ― a price comparable to commercial electricity in the state of
Western Australia. But on a small scale, wave energy is still costly. Carnegie's current design generates
electricity at a cost of about 40 cents a kilowatt-hour. "This is competitive with electricity from diesel."
said Mr. Ottaviano, "hence Carnegie's focus on island nations that rely on diesel." "What is needed is a
well-thought-out wave energy strategy by governments, but which no country has yet formulated. The

A legal change has made it likely that some third-year high school students will become eligible to
vote in next year's House of Councillors election, but little has been done so far to prepare these new
voters for the important decisions they will make at the ballot box.
Educating these youths about their new voting rights is made more urgent by the persistently low
turnout of young voters overall. Unfortunately, only a handful of high schools are offering information
on voting and elections. Many remain unsure how to broach the subject in class while respecting the
political neutrality of education.
Such concerns came to the fore recently when the upper house voted to lower the voting age from 20
to 18 by revising the Public Offices Election Law. The change will likely take effect ahead of an upper
house election in the summer of 2016.
One school that has taken steps to prepare students to take part in elections is Igusa Metropolitan High
School in Nerima Ward, Tokyo. The school has held several ,,mock elections designed to increase
students' awareness of the election process. The first was held in 2012. Students "voted" in the school's
version of the Tokyo gubernatorial and national House of Representatives elections that were held in
December of that year. The students cast votes for actual candidates and parties and the event was
timed to coincide with the real-life polls.
The students chose for themselves whom to vote for after learning that there were different views on
some issues by reading candidates' election pledges and comparing content from various newspapers.
The school also held a mock election for the December 2014 lower house election. Though
participation in the mock elections was voluntary and voting was held after school hours, more than 70
percent of the student body cast ballots ― a high percentage compared with actual voter turnout in
recent elections.
"I'd like to hear what the candidates have to say with my own ears," one student said.
Mr. A, a civics teacher at Igusa High School, said he felt the school's mock elections had heightened
students' awareness of the importance of participating in the political process. "This project wasn't as
difficult as I had expected. I hope more schools will follow our example," said Mr. A.
Mr. B, an associate professor at the University of Tsukuba and an expert in social studies education,
said it was vital that Igusa's efforts be replicated elsewhere.
"To nurture socially responsible voters, teachers need to clear away the walls between the classroom
and society, and they need to willingly handle politics and topical issues," Mr. B said.

Holding mock elections is one method advocated by the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
Technology Ministry to raise interest in elections, but so far only a handful of schools have followed
Igusa's example.
"There are many other things we have to teach," a teacher at a private high school in Tokyo said.
"We can only touch briefly on the voting system and the significance of an election."
Such sentiments are expressed in the context of ^a curriculum that tends to prioritize preparation for
university entrance exams and shy away from instruction on substantive political issues in deference to
preserving the political neutrality of education.
For teachers, this can be a tricky balancing act.
"I think elections are wonderful as practical teaching material, but we have to be highly sensitive when
handling these issues," admitted a 55-year-old civics teacher at a high school in Tokyo.

allowed to mention the names of political parties and
pledges or key election issues. Other gray areas have
"I want the central government to clearly stipulate what points we need to be careful about when we
discuss elections in class," another teacher said.
At high schools that have conducted several of these mock elections, teachers avoid simply drilling
information into the students. They must stay conscious of the need to remain ( b ) and make students
think for themselves by providing balanced instruction on the campaign pledges made by each party.
This can be ( c ) task for inexperienced teachers and school administrations.

The Education Ministry and the Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry are hurriedly preparing
a manual for teachers and new supplementary material for high schools to help them teach students
about the lower voting age.
"We hope to distribute them before the start of the third term," a senior official of the Education
Ministry said.
However, it will be difficult to set aside instruction time on this topic for third-year students after the
New Year comes around, and there will only be about six months between this time and when the
current batch of second-year students who could become eligible to vote will actually go to the polls.
Given these time constraints, the Education Ministry is particularly concerned about ensuring that high
school students do not inadvertently violate election laws.
Third-year classes at high school contain a mix of 18-year-olds who may soon be allowed to vote, and
17-year-olds who will still be too young. An 18-year-old can legally take part in campaigns to spread
election messages on Twitter and other social media sites. If a 17-year-old ― an ineligible voter ― does
the same thing, they run the risk of violating election laws. The Education Ministry plans to explain
igSuch dangers by compiling a list of concrete examples and using illustrations.
For the time being, the education of 18-year-old voters could end up having an emphasis on preventing
election violations. (June 19, 2015 "The Japan News")

mm Japan continues to draw record numbers of foreign visitors. In April, the number hit 1.76 million,
setting new record highs for three months ^in a row. The number of Chinese tourists visiting the
country during the popular cherry blossom season more than doubled compared to a year earlier. The
number of inbound tourists in the first four months of the year surged 43 percent from the same period
of 2014. If the trend continues for the rest of the year, the annual total could reach close to 20 million.
It would not be surprising if the government's goal of welcoming 20 million annual inbound tourists is
achieved well ahead of the target year of 2020, when Tokyo hosts the Summer Olympics. The Abe
administration has set a new goal of ^boosting consumption by inbound tourists from ＼2 trillion last
year to ＼4 trillion by 2020. It hopes to develop inbound tourism into a new engine of the economy that
will generate 400,000 new jobs.
The government should identify what policy steps still need to be taken to make Japan an attractive
destination and should steadily implement the measures so that the inbound tourism boom will become
a long-term trend rather than a temporary phenomenon Bat the mercy of economic and other factors.
With the economy still mired in sluggish growth, the retail industry has come to rely greatly on robust
demand by tourists from other parts of Asia, especially visitors from China, who buy so much that their
shopping sprees have been labeled "explosive." Their total consumption in the January-March quarter
Esurged 64 percent from a year before.
The government has introduced ^measures to promote inbound tourism and consumption, such as
easing visa requirements and expanding the scope of goods that are exempt from the consumption tax.
But the primary reason for the boom is the continuing economic growth in many other Asian economies,
which boosted the income levels of people in those countries and their appetite for overseas travel, and
the yen's fall against other currencies, which made visits to Japan more affordable.
International tourism can be affected by various factors, ranging from economic conditions to tensions
in relations between countries, infectious diseases and natural disasters. Inbound tourism to Japan
^plunged sharply when the nation was hit by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima
nuclear crisis in 2011, and the number of Chinese visitors has risen and fallen Bin accordance with the
state of bilateral ties, which have been repeatedly strained over a series of issues.
To help maintain the upward trend, further government and private-sector efforts are needed to make
Japan more attractive as a travel destination. Such efforts can start with ensuring there is enough staffing
at customs and immigration checkpoints at airports to ^keep pace with the rise in the number of visitors.
The inbound tourism boom has pushed up room occupancy rates at many hotels, with figures topping
80 percent in Tokyo and Osaka last year ― in some cases resulting in room shortages. One solution
would be to diversify the destinations of foreign tourists, which still tend to be concentrated in Tokyo,
Osaka and other well-established tourist areas. Earlier this month, the government identified seven areas
across Japan as alternative routes for inbound tourists, and plans to ^subsidize public-relations
campaigns and other efforts by local organizations.
While attention tends to focus on the surge in the number of foreign visitors and their spending, their
total consumption is still a Bfraction of the demand by domestic tourists, who spent ＼18.8 trillion in
2014, down by ＼1.4 trillion from the previous year. Efforts to revitalize domestic travel demand ―
which is forecast to be on a downward trend with the nation's low birthrate and graying population ―
should also be made to sustain the travel industry. Such an effort can contribute to enhancing Japan's
attraction for all tourists.

Andrea: I've often tried to do that but have never been that successful at it, to tell you the truth.
What I have personally found that really relaxes me though is doing some nighttime reading
before I ( 26 ) off. I keep a great "to read" pile right beside my bed on my nightstand.
Erica: Yes, I too have found that really works. My only problem has been that if I pick something
too exciting, such as a good mystery novel, I can't put it down. I end up getting so ( 27 ) in

Andrea: Totally know what you mean. Can't tell you how often I didn't end up putting the light out
until way after 1:00 AM. I would then sleep through the alarm, so have started to think I
have to try something new.
Erica: I have found that getting ready for the next day also helps. If I prepare everything the night
before, like what I'm going to wear and packing my bag, it gives me one less thing to worry
about and puts my mind to rest. I'm also not ( 28 ) around in the morning.
Andrea: I too try to be quite good about that. Definitely makes for a much less ( 29 ) morning. I also
have found recently that a good stretch before bed helps.
Erica: My mother swore by that. She always used to say that stretching was not only good for her
joints and ( 30 ), but that it also helped her with her sleep. She stretched for about 30
minutes a night religiously. She never became arthritic like her mother either.
Andrea: My mother's habit was to try to go to bed 15 minutes earlier every night than she had
originally planned to. She was always going on about how we all just weren't getting enough
sleep, and how sleep ( 31 ) could have serious effects on our health and productivity the
next day.
Erica: Not a bad idea. If only it were that easy. Heard meditating was quite effective too. It's
supposed to help decrease stress levels and give you ( 32 ) of mind.
Andrea: Yes, the benefits of meditating seem endless; apparently better memory, more creativity and
less anxiety.

Bfl There is inequality in any society. Even in the simplest hunter-gatherer band, some people are
bigger, stronger, or smarter than others. Further, some people have more power than others: they are
more able to determine the behavior of others than vice versa. Some people acquire more wealth than
others. Some people are given more status and respect than others.
Physical and intellectual capacities, power, wealth, and status may or may not (1. R grip, c go,
c have, c become) together. Successful athletes, artists, and scientists usually enjoy status, but only
in some societies do they enjoy wealth as well, and rarely do they have political power. Politicians in
some countries can enjoy status and power without wealth; businesspeople can have wealth and power
without status. Such inconsistencies among the various areas of inequality are often felt to be problematic.
In some societies people try to (2. c resolve, c repeat, c regain, c research) them by making
the areas more consistent. Athletes turn professional to become wealthy; politicians exploit their power
and / or move onto attractive business positions in order to do the same; successful businesspeople enter
public office in order to acquire status. This (3. c wealth, c trend, c equality, c status) obviously
increases the overall inequalities in these societies.
In other societies the dominant feeling is that it is a good thing, rather than a problem, if a person's
rank in one area does not match his or her rank in another. A high rank in one area should partly be
*offset by a low rank in another. This process increases the size of the middle class in-between those
who are on top in all (4. c societies, c people, c laws, c respects) and those who lack any kind
of opportunity. The laws in many countries have been conceived to serve this ideal of equality by
treating everybody as equal, but there are (5. c few, c a few, c many, c entire) societies in
which reality matches the ideal.

Ui (A) Around the world, food waste is increasingly seen as a serious environmental and economic
issue. With many families on tight budgets and the global population growing every year, there is
increasing awareness of the resources used carelessly to produce food that is never eaten.
The United Nations estimates that a third of all the food produced in the world is never consumed,
resulting in a total of about 1.3 billion tons of waste a year. In the United States alone, about 40
percent of all food, worth an estimated $165 billion, is wasted, according to a 2012 report.
It is estimated that the food discarded in the developed world by retailers and consumers alone
would be more than enough to feed the world's 870 million hungry people.
The main idea of this passage is that we should
c be able to produce more food for an increasing population.
c not waste produced food.
c visit the United States in order to see how food is wasted.
c tell retailers and consumers in the developed world to feed the world's hungry people.
(B) In Britain, which has some of the most comprehensive data on food waste available, each family
discards, on average, $1,170 worth of food a year.
The environmental consequences of waste are enormous with vast quantities of water, fertilizer and
land used to produce food that is never eaten, and with fuel burned to process, refrigerate, and
transport it.
In developing nations, food waste often happens soon after harvesting, when crops are being stored
or transported, because a shortage of refrigeration and good roads makes it difficult to get food to
market before it spoils. In wealthier countries, waste often begins with retailers rejecting items that
they think will not appeal to customers. But the single biggest force of waste is in homes, where about
half of all uneaten food is estimated to be discarded.
The Food and Agriculture Organization has sought to draw attention to the issue with its campaign,
which urges shoppers to plan before shopping and to freeze more food. The campaign advises that
people should also trust their eyes and noses rather than relying on sell-by dates to decide whether
food is spoiled. The organization is working with supermarket chains to reduce waste by clarifying
expiration dates and selling smaller portions.
According to the passage, which statement is true?
c In Britain, $1,170 worth of food a year is available.

Food waste has little to do with the environment.
Freezing more food decreases the amount of food discarded.
The Food and Agriculture Organization advises people to rely on sell-by dates in order to live a
healthy life.
(C) Such efforts have helped Britain cut food waste by 21 percent since 2007. It is said to be the only
country in Europe to have achieved such a reduction,
Tesco, the first British supermarket chain to publish its waste figures, reported that 28,500 tons of
food went to waste in its stores and distribution centers in the first half of 2013 ― 0.87 percent of its
sales volume. That is only a small fraction of total waste in the country, however. The most frequently
wasted items are fresh produce and baked goods, according to a spokesman for Tesco. He said that
bags of lettuce top the list with 68 percent of total production discarded.
The supermarket chain is looking at such "waste hot spots" and has introduced lettuce in bags with
two compartments, so that consumers can use one half while the other stays fresh, the spokesman
said. Tesco is improving some supply processes so that grapes, for example, arrive in stores five to ten
days sooner, giving consumers more time to eat them, he said.
According to the passage, which statement is true?
c Tesco succeeded in reducing food waste by 21 percent in 2007 compared with the previous year.
(D Lettuce accounts for 68 percent of the profits that Tesco generates.

(D) In South Korea, a major effort to reduce food waste has come at the government level. In the hope
of reducing food waste by 20 percent, the country has introduced a system that charges for garbage
disposal by weight.
Chinese leaders issued a memo urging officials to scale back on lavish banquets, instructing
government-run cafeterias to serve smaller portions and asking restaurants to make it easier to order
less, the Chinese official news agency reported. The government is also drafting a law on food waste,
the agency reported.
In the United States, the state of Massachusetts is requiring any institution that throws out more
than a ton of food waste each week to *compost it instead.
In Greece, the economic crisis has also driven a new focus on waste. One group in the country
started an online hub to help small shops with excess food connect with people in need nearby.
*compost: allow food to decay so that it can be added to soil to help plants grow
According to the passage, which idea is implied?

food waste.

"It's probably only necessary to explain to them that they are wasting more food than they think."

People visit other countries for many reasons. Some travel on business, while others travel to take
a break from life's routines and stress. Others travel to visit famous places. Still others go abroad to
deepen their understanding of another culture. But regardless of ,,,the purpose of your trip, there are
e≫± 2017 ±a*^AHF=1i!IE8f c

certain things you should always do when you travel abroad.
Being properly prepared should be your first step. Make sure ^you have the right paperwork. Having
the wrong visa or a passport that is about to expire can cause real problems. Also, make sure you have
good medical insurance, so that if you are sick or injured during your travels you will be able to get
treatment. If you take medication with you, keep it in its original container. If you travel with
prescription drugs, bring a letter from your doctor. If you don't, you might have problems with customs
officials at your destination. Finally, if you want to rent a car, make sure you have an international
driver's license and understand the local traffic laws.
The second thing you should do is to consider steps for your safety. While most people that you meet
are sure to be friendly, there are dangers ― theft being the most (3)common. Just as in your home
country, do not expect everyone you meet to be honest. Always keep your valuables out of sight, or in
the hotel safe. Another safety tip when abroad is to do daily errands or go sightseeing with at least one
other person. Two people are much safer than ( 4 ). If there is no one to go sightseeing with, at least
tell someone (hotel staff or other travelers) where you are going that day, and when you expect to return.
When you get to your destination, use only officially-approved buses and taxis. Never accept rides,
from strangers who offer you a lift. If there is no meter in the taxi, agree on a ( 5 ) before you get in.
And always be aware of where the bus or taxi is going. Visitors often make mistakes when using public
transportation in a foreign country. These mistakes can lead to big problems if you do not realize them
soon enough.
Finally, be ready to communicate with local people. Learn some basic words in the local language, and
learn how to say common expressions and ask basic questions. Most importantly, remember to smile! It
is ,cthe friendliest form of communication and is understood in every part of the world!
Following these basic steps will not guarantee a perfect trip. But it will greatly reduce the chances of
problems, and allow you to enjoy your travels ― wherever you go, and for whatever reason. Bon voyage!

E9 Stephen Hawking, one of the world's most important scientists, believes that to survive, humans
must move into space: "Once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future
should be safe," he says.
Today, the European Union, India, China, Russia, and Japan are all planning to send astronauts back

to Earth's closest neighbor: the moon. I 12 I there between 2020 and 2030. These stations will
prepare humans to visit and later live on Mars or other Earth-like planets.
Robert Zubrin, a rocket scientist, also thinks humans should colonize space. He wants to start with
Mars. Why? He thinks sending people to Mars will allow us to learn a lot ― for example, I 13 I in
a very different environment. Then we can eventually create new human societies on other planets. In
addition, any advances we make in the fields of science, technology, medicine, and health will also
benefit us here on Earth.
SpaceX is a company that builds rockets. Its owner, Elon Musk, also believes we should colonize Mars,
but he doesn't want just one small colony. He doesn't want to send just "one little mission;" I 14 I .
Not everyone thinks sending humans into space is a smart idea. Many say it's too expensive, even if
it's just a short journey. And most space trips are not short. A one-way trip to Mars, for example,
would take about six months. People traveling this kind of distance face many health problems. Also,
these first people would find life extremely difficult out in space. On the moon's surface, for example,
the sun's rays are very dangerous. I 15. 1 most of the time.
Despite these concerns, sending people into space seems certain. In the future, we might see lunar
cities or even new human cultures on other planets. First stop: the moon.

According to Stephen Hawking, what should we do to make our existence safe in the future?
We should establish independent colonies out in the cosmos.
We should make many lunar cities as soon as possible.
We should start by sending people beyond our solar system.
We should create as many colonies as we like on Mars.
Which of the following would be most likely to happen?
We would return to the moon.
We would make space stations on Mars to prepare for exploration beyond.
We would live on another planet outside the cosmos.
We would make a short journey to Earth.
What do many people say about visiting another planet?
Sending humans into space is very clever.
It is cheap if it's just a short journey.
They could find many strange creatures on other planets.
It is too costly.

H] Perhaps no single monument in the USA is as famous as the Statue of Liberty. Standing on a
small island in New York Harbor, the crowned lady, holding aloft in her right hand the torch of freedom
and in her left hand a tablet inscribed "July 4th, 1776," is a symbol of American democracy. She is
colossal. She is 151 ft. high and the pedestal on which she stands is almost as tall. An elevator takes
visitors to the top of the pedestal, around which a balcony runs. A spiral staircase goes up to the crown,
and another to the torch. The Statue of Liberty was a gift to the USA from France in 1886, as a mark
of friendship and also in memory of the aid France gave the Americans during the American Revolution.
[2] For millions of immigrants*, the Statue was their first sight of the ^promised land, and for a few it
was also the last, as they sailed back home again to a future without hope. About a mile from Liberty
Island, there is another small island, called Ellis Island, which was looked upon with great fear by
immigrants. For it was here that they had to wait their turn to be examined by doctors and officials.
Most of the immigrants could not speak a word of English. But only two out of 100 immigrants were
refused admission to New York City. Often the person refused turned out to be a grandmother or a
weary, frightened girl mistakenly labeled "feeble-minded*." Sometimes husbands and wives were
parted because one of them happened to have a bad cough and was suspected of having tuberculosis*.
02 New York City was a bitter disappointment to some immigrants. Far from being a city paved* with
gold, it was a city with overcrowded, unhealthy, and unsafe ghettos*. The immigrants looked for
earlier immigrants of their own nationality or religion. So Italian, Polish, Irish, Jewish neighborhoods
grew up. Because they could not speak English, the newcomers found it difficult to get work at once,
and their living quarters* were often slums.
|4] However, they found in the USA opportunities of bettering themselves and of escaping from the
cruel rule which many of them had suffered in their own countries. ,mTo that extent, the Statue of
them an honest welcome.
E Today's immigrants no longer have to endure ;r,the indignities of Ellis Island. The grim buildings
were closed down in 1924. In 1976, Ellis Island became a historic monument.

desired by a hundred lovers. It was a place fought over for its vast riches, I 29 I its forested hills,
productive volcanic soils and harbours full of seafood. Today, the city's sparkling waters, varied
landscapes and vibrant urban lifestyle combine to make it one of the most desirable places in the

With the growth of the Internet, tourism, and the global economy, it feels like the world is getting
smaller. Ideas, products, and customs are flying from country to country in the blink of an eye. As
these cultural exports grow, the world is slowly but I 34 I becoming a global village.
Entertainment is one of the most popular cultural exports. Every year, movies from Hollywood are
watched by billions of people worldwide. I 35 I. TV shows and music are making their way from
America to Asia. As people enjoy these entertainment products, they also learn about the ideas and
values of other cultures.

Fashion is another big cultural export. In the past, it took months for trends to I 36 I to other
countries. Now, with the Internet, a new style from Paris can become famous overnight. Plus, today's
super-fast shipping means that a shop in South Africa can receive European goods in I 37 I.
Some people are unhappy about the rapid spread of foreign cultures. They worry it will harm their
local 1 38 I. For sure, young people are often interested in new ideas and products from abroad. Yet
the more we learn about each other, the closer we become. That helps export our most important
cultural products: greater understanding and world peace.

SSJ In 2010, Uniqlo formed a joint venture with Grameen Healthcare Trust in Bangladesh. The
purpose of Grameen Uniqlo is to sell clothes made by locals, for locals, at affordable prices for people
living near the poverty line, and to nurture local retailing expertise. But as the local retail staff diligently
counted their door-to-door sales of T-shirts, priced at $1 or $2, from village to village, the company that
owns Uniqlo, Fast Retailing Co., realized it had come accross a wealth of untapped data on a rapidly
growing economy.
"We learned which communities wanted bright reds and greens, which preferred muted tones," Fast
Retailing Senior Vice President Yukihiro Nitta said in an interview. "We learned to stock more men's
wear, because women who wear saris buy mostly leggings and home wear."
When the venture opened its first stores in Dhaka in July, Mr. Nitta discovered that in a shop full of $2
and $3 items, shoppers will spend $10 for a pair of jeans or $9 for a shirt with a collar that can be used
on more formal occasions. The stores now stock 70% to 75% of a store's floor space with items for men.

KB If we truly want to achieve world peace, we have to get rid of weapons of war. And the world is
full of weapons ― guns, rockets, tanks, landmines. What are landmines? Landmines are special bombs
which are buried in the ground. They're designed to explode when a person steps on them. Landmines
are one of the cruelest weapons of war. Why? Because they don't discriminate between soldiers and
civilians. Their casualties include men and women, adults and children, young and old. Even after wars
end, mthey can remain for days, months and years waiting for innocent victims.
Do you know any landmine victims? I do. My brother-in-law is a landmine survivor. He's an
American journalist. Back in the 1960s, he was sent to Asia to report on the Vietnam War. One day, he
was walking with a group of American soldiers through the jungle. The soldiers were carrying rifles. He
was carrying his camera and notebook. As he was walking, he suddenly stepped on a landmine buried
in the ground. Instantly, the landmine exploded, sending pieces of metal up into his body. Normally, he
would have died instantly. But, somehow he survived the explosion. The soldiers quickly called for an
army helicopter. The helicopter took him to a nearby military hospital. After an emergency
^operation, he was taken to Saigon for further medical care. Eventually, he was flown back to New
York where he spent one year in hospital. Thanks to his doctors, he slowly recovered. But even now, 50
years later, he still suffers terrible pain from his injuries. To manage this pain, he swims an hour each
day in a swimming pool. He's lucky to be alive!
Hundreds of people around the world have worked to eliminate landmines. Famous celebrities
connected to ,,,this movement include Princess Diana of England and pop singer Paul McCartney.

Hot Defensive Bee Ball
In nature, animals threatened by enemies display various kinds of adaptive behaviors to escape or
actively defend themselves against the enemies. Honeybees commonly use their stingers* to
counterattack an intruder. Japanese honeybees, ((D), fight against the giant hornet,* their most
horrible natural enemy, by displaying a characteristic behavior called "hot defensive bee ball
5 formation."* In fall, giant hornets attack Japanese honeybee colonies. If a hornet tries to enter the
beehive, a group of more than 500 worker bees quickly swarm around the hornet, trapping it inside
the bee ball. In the ball formation, honeybees vibrate their flight muscles to produce heat. The
temperature in the ball quickly rises to almost 47° C, which is deadly to the hornet. The high
temperature phase continues for approximately 20 minutes. Within 30 to 60 minutes after the
10 formation of the bee ball, the hornet is killed by the heat produced.
( (D ), European honeybees, which are a related species and were introduced to Japan in the Meiji
era (about 140 years ago), exhibit only stinging behavior against hornets. The outer skin of the
giant hornet, however, is too thick for a bee to sting, and colonies of European honeybees are often
completely destroyed. While this discovery may seem to demonstrate that the Japanese honeybee is
15 "smarter" than its European counterpart, this is not the case. There are no giant hornets in Europe.
They inhabit Asia, including Japan. So, it's merely an evolutionary consequence of adaptation to the
threat of natural enemies.
( (D ) this "hot defensive bee ball" behavior has been known for some time, the mechanism
behind it has been hidden in a veil of mystery. But researchers at Japan's University of Tokyo,
20 through study of the bees' brains, have detected a previously undiscovered kind of neural* activity
that takes place when the bees engage in "hot defensive bee balling." The researchers were
astonished by the fact that the collective heat generated by the group, while fatal for the hornet,
leaves the bees unaffected. Even more surprisingly, they used perfectly coordinated teamwork
during the process. When an outsider enters, the honeybees are immediately on their guard. Then
25 all at once, they gather to attack. So, it's not that one commands all the rest. They are acting
collectively in an emergency. Curious about why the bees attack this way, the researchers examined
their brains and found that neural activity in bees involved with the "hot defensive bee ball"
increased. It's a kind of neural activity that isn't seen in European honeybees, taking place in the
higher brain center.*

When people talk about university today you often hear the phrase "return on investment." In
other words, how much money you will get out of doing it, mrelative to the amount that you have put in.
What no one seems to ask is what the "return" that university is supposed to give you is. Is it just about
earning more money? Is the only purpose of an education to enable you to get a job? What, we need to
ask ourselves, is university for?
There has been ,,a lot of debate recently in the United States about higher education, especially about
increasing school fees, rising student debt, and the tough labor market for new graduates. We talk about
the future of the university: budget cuts, distance learning, online courses, and whether the university in
its present form is even necessary. We talk about national competitiveness, the twenty-first-century
labor force, technology and engineering, and the prospects for our future prosperity. But we never talk
about the principles that underlie this conversation, as if what makes for a happy life or a good society
were perfectly obvious, and as if n)in either case the one and only answer were more money.
Of course money matters: jobs matter, financial security matters, national prosperity matters. The
question is, are they the only things that matter? Life is more than a job; a job is more than a salary; and
a nation is more than its ( X ). Education is more than the obtaining of marketable* skills, and you are
PEZtt 2017 £D*^AHFp1HIER ･
S*R*(X)
-50-
more than your ability to contribute to your employer's profitability or the nation's GDP*, no matter
what politicians and business executives would like you to think. To ask what university is for is to ask
what life is for, what society is for: ( Y ), what people are for.
Do students ever hear this? What they hear is a constant drumbeat that seeks to march them in the
opposite direction. When policy makers talk about higher education, from the president all the way
down, they talk exclusively in terms of math and science. Journalists and commentators ― some of
whom majored in humanities* and none of whom are nurses or engineers ― never tire of lecturing the
young about the foolishness of wanting to learn things just because you're curious about them. "Top Ten
Majors" means the most employable, not the most interesting. "Top Ten Fields of Study" means above-
average income, not job satisfaction. "What are you going to do with (4)that?" someone will inevitably
ask when they hear that a young person is thinking of applying to study for a humanities degree.
I'm not sure what the "practical" people are so concerned about. MAfter all, not many of our students
are demanding to get into classes on Shakespeare and Socrates. English literature is now, alas, the
choice of only 3 percent of students. Business, at 21 percent, accounts for more than one and a half
times as many undergraduates as all of the arts and humanities combined. In 1972, 73 percent of
freshmen at American universities said that it was essential or very important to "develop a meaningful
philosophy of life," 37 percent to be "very wealthy": ,clnot just wealthy, but very wealthy. By 2012, the
numbers were almost reversed, 47 percent and 80 percent, respectively. For years we've been loudly
announcing that happiness is money (or even better, money and fame). No wonder students have come
to believe that university is all about getting a job.
Of course you need to get a job, but you also need to get a life. What's the return on investment of
university? What's the return on investment of having children, spending time with friends, reading a
book, doing volunteer work, traveling?
that are most worth
own sake. Anyone who tells you that the only purpose
are
is the obtaining of marketable skills
is attempting to reduce you to a productive employee at work, a passive consumer in the market, and an
obedient citizen of the nation. When we ask ourselves what university is for, we must remember that the
question is really about our ability to remain fully human.

WM What is language for? It fulfils two main functions: it tells us about things, and it allows us to
interact, in various ways, with other members of our species ― from encounters in shops and banks, to
chatting with friends, family and lovers. And in ,,.so doing, we attempt to influence the actions, thoughts
and feelings of others. Both functions allow us to communicate with one another.
( X ) of communication, language has much in common with many others that abound in nature.
The distinctive colouring of some species provides a signal that is interpreted by potential predators* as a
warning of danger. An example is the yellow and black stripes of wasps*.
Of course, we wouldn't normally consider the message signalled by body colour to be language-like.
Communication systems are usually thought to involve some level of ,,,intentionality ― the signaller, to
some degree, is consciously conveying a message, in a specific context, for some particular purpose.
Moreover, communication systems found in the wild can be more or less complex, more or less
individually learned, and more or less flexibly applied to a range of contexts. Some of the most
significant complexity associated with non-human communication system involves birdsong, and the
songs of whales. The greatest flexibility is associated with the naturally occurring gestures of apes, such
as chimpanzees, which also appear to be individually learned.
To gain a sense of the sorts of communication systems that abound in the wild, consider the honeybee.
Honeybees live in large colonies consisting of a queen bee, male bees and worker bees, which are the
offspring of the queen and male bees. In a famous study, Karl von Frisch, the Austrian biologist and
Nobel Prize winner, was the first to figure out the significance of the dance of the honeybees. We now
know with certainty that honeybees, as well as other species, are capable of communicating
about the location of food. Once a worker has located a source of nectar*, it returns to
can refer to
from declaring
the hive* in
to signal the location to the other bees. This is achieved via a sophisticated dance
performed on a wall inside the hive. The dance indicates the distance of the food source from the hive,
as well as its direction.
While bees communicate through dance, other species rely on voice. A striking example is the alarm
calls made by vervet monkeys*, which live in southern and eastern Africa. Vervets make specific and
distinct calls upon sight of different predators: the sound they make when they see a snake is different
from the (4)ones they make when they spot an eagle or leopard.
Clearly, while communicative systems such as K, these are interesting, they are highly restricted in
terms of their communicative value. In the case of both bees and vervet monkeys the symbolic systems
used are limited to specific contexts of use. This is not, of course, to reduce the importance of those
contexts, and the value of the communicative systems for the well-being and survival of the species. But
eternal
guage is much more flexible in the variety of situations tha
to negotiating a peace treaty to commenting on the weather.
And, it is flexible in another way too ― different communities of humans adopt different linguistic
varieties: Swahili, Japanese and English are all quite distinct, in a range of ways. This is because the
system itself is naturally flexible. Its flexibility arises from a process that allows us to combine otherwise
meaningless symbols. Sounds and words can be combined variously, following the 'rules' of an abstract
grammar, individually learned, that humans carry around with them in their heads. It is perhaps this
capability that [,,,(≫) the communication systems / (b) from / (c) human language / (d) most distinguishes]

As a communication system, the dance of the honeybee is as complicated as human language.
Close similarities are found between human language and the vervet monkey's alarm calls.
Essentially, human language is no different from many non-human communication systems.
Human language is more flexible than other communication systems in at least two respects.
The only purposes of both animal communication and human language are well-being and
survival.

Exploring is not necessarily about finding
£W)~(1 oit;^ $
places that you never knew existed. Think of the moon,
for example. Human beings have always known it was there, but astronauts didn't explore it until 1969.
For medieval Europeans, much of Asia and the Far East might as well have been the moon. They had
heard of countries called Persia and China, but they knew next to ( 1 ) about them.
So, it is surprising to discover that China and Europe had been trading since Roman times. The key to
it all was silk. This beautiful material is woven from thread produced by silkworms. Chinese silk was
finer than all others, and the Chinese guarded the secrets of its manufacture ( 2 ).
Wealthy Europeans had always loved to dress in silk. Every year great amounts of it were transported
overland and sold for huge amounts of money. Back in the other direction, west ( 3 ) east, went goods
such as horses, wool, silver, and gold. Over the centuries, a network of tracks spread across Asia.
Together, they came to be known as the Silk Road.
( 4 ) the goods traveled thousands of miles, few of the merchants did. Instead, a trader would buy
something of value, transport it part of the way, then, sell it to another trader, who would do the same.
This was partly for ( 5 ) ― the distance between the Chinese capital (today's Beijing) and the great
trading port of Venice was more than 5,000 miles ― and partly for safety, as the routes could be
extremely dangerous. ★

When Tim started a new job as a manager, one of his top priorities was communicating to his
office team that he valued each member's contribution. So at team meetings, as each member spoke up
about whatever project they were working ( X ), Tim made sure he put on his "active-listening face" to
signal that he cared about what each person was saying.
But after meeting with him a few times, Tim's team got a very different message from mthe one he
intended to send. After a few weeks of meetings, one team member was finally brave enough to ask
him the question that had been on everyone's mind. That question was: "Tim, are you angry with us right
now?" When Tim explained that he wasn't at all angry ― that he was just putting on his "active-listening
face"― his colleague gently explained that his active-listening face looked a lot like his angry face.
According to Heidi Grant Halvorson, a social psychologist at Columbia Business School who has
extensively researched how people perceive* one another, Tim's story captures one of the primary
problems of being a human being: although you might wish to ( Y ) in a certain way to others, people
often perceive you in an altogether different way.
One person may think, for example, that by offering help to a colleague, others will see her as
generous. But
misunderstands
her offer as a lack of trust in his abilities. Just as he
she misunderstands him: she offered him help because she thought he was
overworked and stressed. He has, after all, been showing up early to work and going home late every
day. But that's not why he's,,,keeping strange hours; he just works best when the office is less crowded.
These kinds of misunderstandings lead to conflict and resentment not just at work, but at home too.
How many fights between couples have started with one person not understanding what another says
and does? He stares at his plate at dinner while she's telling a story and she ( Zi ) he doesn't care
about what she's saying, when really he is admiring the beautiful meal she made. She goes to bed early
rather than watching their favorite television show together like they usually do, and he ( Z2 ) she's not
interested in spending time with him, when really she's just exhausted after a tough day at work.
Most of the time, Halvorson says, people don't realize they are not seen by others the way they think
they are. "If I ask you," Halvorson told me, "about how you see yourself ― what traits* you would say
describe you ― and I ask someone who knows you well to list your traits, there will not be much
correlation* between what you say and what your friend says. There's a big gap between how other
people see us and how we see ourselves."
mThis gap arises, Halvorson explains, from some quirks* of human psychology. First, most people
suffer from what psychologists call ",c,the transparency illusion" ― the belief that what they feel, desire,
and intend is very clear to others, even though they have done very little to communicate clearly what is
going on inside their minds. Because people presume they are transparent, they might not spend the
time or effort to be as clear about their intentions or emotional states as they could be, giving people
around them very little information with which to make an accurate judgment.
"It's quite possible," Halvorson writes, "that how you look when you are slightly frustrated isn't all
that different from how you look when you are a little concerned, confused, disappointed, or nervous.
Your 'I'm kind of hurt by what you just said' face probably looks a lot like your 'I'm not at all hurt by
what you just said' face. And the majority of times that you've said to yourself, 'I made my intentions
clear,' or 'He knows what I meant,' you didn't, and mhe doesn't."

I want you to travel with me to a famine camp* in Sudan on the Ethiopian border. You may have seen
the dreadful television reports of the starving babies, their bellies swollen. Flies crawl in and out of their
eyes and mouths, trying to suck the last drops of moisture that cling there as long as these babies cling to
life. Now you are among them, as a reporter for a daily newspaper, required to write about a place you
have never been before, about an event you can't possibly understand, for readers who will never go
there and,,,don't know what it has to do with them ― beyond giving money to charity.
You've been at the camp for several days. You walk its ground each day, stepping around and over
,,,100,000 people who have come because they heard there was water. ( X ) the time they arrived ―
some of them walking three weeks from their Ethiopian villages ― the water was no more than a well of
mud in a dry riverbed.
You watch the little girls walk to the river and dig in the mud, soaking their old torn clothes with
moisture that they wring*, drop by drop, into their plastic cups. You sit in the clinic where the waiting
line is hundreds of people long. Desperate fathers push their babies at you, thinking that because you
are a khawaja, a foreigner, you must be a doctor. You must be able to help. But all you have to offer is
a notebook and some questions―,,,suddenly too little to capture this reality.
At night you retreat to the other side of the straw wall that encloses this awful world. You collapse―
( Y ) of your temporary hunger, of your selfish fears ― on a bed in a small straw hut*. You're grateful
that it's dark, that you will not have to look at things for a few hours, but you can still hear. You hear
coughing and crying. You hear shouts, angry bursts of life, and the final sounds people make as they die.
Then you hear something else: singing. You hear sweet chants and deep rhythms. Each night, over
and over, at about the same time. You think you are dreaming. You wonder if you have gone quite mad
from your fear. How could people sing in the face of this horror? And why? You lie in the dark and
you wonder until you fall asleep. Daylight comes again, and you open your eyes.
I went to Africa in 1985 to report on the Ethiopian famine for a newspaper. I had never been outside

1 Mothers nowadays may feel like they're too busy to sit down, and ,,many probably are, but a
recent report suggests that on average they are far more sedentary ― in other words, spend more time
seated ― than moms were 50 years ago.
Since 1965, women with children have spent increasingly more time watching television and driving,
and increasingly less time playing with children, doing chores*, and exercising, according to the report.
In 1965, mothers of children aged 5 to 18 spent 14.2 more hours a week being physically active than
being sedentary. In 2010, they spent 3.8 more hours a week being sedentary than they did on physical
activity.
The authors of the report used data from a representative sample of American people over the past
fifty years. For the purposes of the report, physical activity" was defined as time spent cooking and
cleaning, along with playing with children and exercising. Sedentary activity was everything else non-
work-related, such as time spent watching television, surfing the Internet, as well as time spent driving.
They found that
per week less in 2010
with older children
were physically active for about 11 hours
in 1965. Among moms with children younger than 5, the decline was nearly
14 hours a week. Today, in 2010, the two groups are physically active for 20.9 and 29.7 hours each
week, respectively.
Though we might think unemployed mothers have more time for exercise, physical activity has
decreased more among mothers who don't work than among those who have full-time jobs. However,
nowadays, moms who don't work still spend more total time being physically active than those who
(4)do. Mothers with older children have also increased their sedentary time by 7 hours a week since
1965. The increase was 5.7 hours a week for mothers with younger children. Again, unemployed
mothers saw greater increases in sedentary time. ( X ), mothers today burn between 1,238 and 5,835
calories less each week than mothers did in the 1960s. A kilogram of fat is roughly 9,000 calories.
Of course, much of the decline has to do ( Y ) housework. Dishwashers didn't become a common
part of middle-class homes until the 1970s, and clothes washers and dryers were too expensive for many
until the 1980s. Few women today would likely say that their preferred form of exercise is washing
clothes by hand.
But the other side of the technological-advancement argument is how widespread M screen-based
entertainment is: physical activity time reached a low point in the 1990s, according to the report
authors, just as the Internet became popular and TVs greatly decreased in price.
If mothers set examples for children, they're increasingly modeling a screen- and car-based existence,
which will probably not be good for either their own or their kids' health. Not only does a pregnant
woman's body mass index* affect the health of her fetus*, the report authors say ,c,kids raised by
sedentary parents are less likely to have healthy habits themselves. "Evidence suggests that mothers'
behavior may also play a role in determining the risk of obesity* in children," they point out.
It's not clear what the solution is here. According to a study, among couples with children, when both
parents work full-time, women do more housework, childcare, and other household tasks each week,
leaving many feeling like they already come home to a "second job." Many unemployed mothers, on
the other hand, likely don't have the resources to join exercise classes, or even to pay for an hour of
babysitting so they can jog around the block. There was very little good about the days when women
essentially stayed at home, and were unpaid manual laborers, but ( Z ) that lifestyle might have been
better for their physical fitness.

E9 One day, John popped into a convenience store to buy a cup of coffee. He poured his coffee and
took the cup to the table that had the cup covers, sugar, and other coffee-related things. The coffee cup
was very hot, so the first thing on his ( X ) was getting a cardboard* holder to place it in. His hand was
starting to feel uncomfortable from the heat, but he had to wait because the store was crowded and three
people were blocking his path to the cup holders. They were a mother with her two children, a young
girl and a slightly older boy.
The mother had a hot cup of coffee in her right hand and urgently wanted to slip it into a holder. Her
left hand was carrying a couple of things she wanted to purchase, so she asked the boy to take a holder
from the rack, mwhich he did. The holder was pressed flat, and she asked him to open it and hold it on
the table so that she could slip her cup into it.

that he should hold it between his thumb and fingers

He tried to wrap the flattened cardboard around the cup she was holding.
The mother had a ( Y ) expression on her face ― one that John probably shared ― because her hand
was getting very hot. At this point, the little girl, clearly frustrated by her big brother's inability to see
what could be done with the flattened holder, took it from his hand, pinched it so that it expanded into a
ring, and then placed it on the table for her mother to slip the cup into. Only just in time.

In an experiment, a team of developmental psychologists showed five-year-old, six-year-old, and
seven-year-old children a miniature room that contained a teddy bear, and told the children that the
teddy bear wanted a toy out of reach on a high shelf inside that room. The room also contained a box
and a few other objects that the bear could potentially use to help solve ,.,the problem. Unsurprisingly,
the older children were more likely than the younger children to use the box as a platform for the bear

to stand on and reach the toy. ,filThe few
children who were able to think of this solution
needed more time than the older ones to figure it out.
That's what happened when the box was presented separately from the other objects. For a different
group of kids, (7)it was initially filled with the other objects, reminding them of a box's usual function as
a container. When the box contained something, the younger children were more likely than the older
ones to think of it as a platform for the bear to stand on. They also thought of this solution more
quickly than the older kids. The little ones' relative lack of life experience enabled them to consider the
wider possibilities that were not thought of by the older children.

El It is hard to say who first put fish on the menu. The invention of the grand 'modern' style of
cookery in Europe has usually been traced ( 1 ) to the Sicilians or their neighbors, the people of the
town of Sybaris, a short way across the sea at the tip of Southern Italy. In the year 510 these people
were defeated by the Sicilians and their city destroyed, but stories of their fabulous riches were ( 2 )
being told hundreds of years later. One historian recorded a law in Sybaris that gave the inventor of a

the inventor a small sum of money. ( 3 ), he claimed that in Sybaris fishers and fish-sellers did not
have to pay tax.
Fish also seems to have been very important in the food culture of Sicily. According to one source,
they called the sea itself 'sweet' because they so ( 4 ) the food that came out of it. Sicily also produced
the first cookbooks. Among the earliest was one by a famous chef called Mithaecus. Very few of his
books remain, but the few fragments that we still have today show how central fish was to the diet of his
time and place. In one of these fragments Mithaecus advises: 'Cut off the head of the ribbon fish*.
Wash it and cut it into slices. Pour cheese and oil over it'― one of the earliest ( 5 ) recipes.

Sitting at the front of the grade four classroom in her school uniform, Priscilla Sitienei listens
carefully while she writes the English names of animals in her notebook. She joined Leaders Vision
Preparatory School* five years ago and has also served her village in the Rift Valley in Kenya* as a
midwife* for the last sixty-five years. In fact, she has helped deliver some of her own classmates, who
are aged ten to fourteen.
Fondly known as "Gogo", which means grandmother in the local Kalenjin language*, she says that at
age ninety she is finally learning to read and write ― an opportunity she never had as a child. More
comfortable speaking in Kalenjin than English, she explains why she wanted to return to school. "I'd
like to be able to read the Bible. I also want to m inspire children to get an education. Too many older
children are not in school. They even have children themselves."
Gogo says she,,, confronts children who are not in school and asks them why. "They tell me they are too
old," she says. "I tell them, 'Well I go to school and so should you.' I see children who are lost, children
who are without fathers, just, a, going round and round, hopeless. I want to inspire them to go to school."
At first, the school officials Mturned her away. However, they soon understood how,,,committed she
was to learning. The head teacher, David Kinyanjui, believes that Gogo, who lives in the village school,
is ,,,an example to the rest of her class. "I'm very proud of her," he says. "Gogo has been a blessing to
this school. She has been a positive influence on all the pupils. She is loved by every pupil, and they all
want to learn and play with her. She is doing well, and I can say I have seen a big difference in this
school since she came."
Sitienei grew up in Kenya when it was occupied by the British, and she lived through her country's
(5)struggle for independence. Now a school leader, she stakes part in all of the classes ― math, English,
P.E.*, dance, drama, and singing. Dressed in her blue school uniform and green sweater, she also tells
stories to her classmates to make sure her knowledge of local customs is Mpassed on. The children sit
under trees near the playing fields and listen to every word she says.
An eleven-year-old girl says she is Gogo's best friend because Gogo tells stories to, and goes to P.E.
with, the students. A ten-year-old school boy says the grandmother also likes to mikeep them in order.
"We love Gogo because when we make noise she tells us to keep quiet," he says.
The current record for the oldest elementary school pupil in the Guinness Book of Records* is held by
＼ another Kenyan, the late Kimani Maruge. He went to school at the age of eighty-four, in 2004, and died
five years later. Sitienei's elementary school says it will write to the record keepers to inform them
about their ninety-year-old student.
"I want to say to the children of the world, especially girls, that education will be your wealth. Don't
look back and run to your father," she says. "With education you can be whatever you want, a doctor, a
lawyer, or a pilot." Gogo's own lesson is that it is never too late.

U fcOZbttU/vt?, MWcgx.fcSv*,,
When Charles Darwin, famous for his scientific theory of evolution by natural selection, visited the
Galapagos Islands* in the 1830s, he made an interesting discovery about the native birds. He noticed
that thirteen ,a,individual species of finches* were similar in many ways, yet the size and shape of their
beaks* were different. Some of the birds had long, thin beaks, whereas others had short, thick ones.
Still others had shapes somewhere in between. As a result, Darwin mfigured that these species had come
from a common ancestor. Put another way, he thought that a single species of bird had eventually
evolved* into the thirteen distinct species that he had observed. But how and why had this happened?
Why did all the birds have beaks of different lengths?
Darwin noticed that each of the species occupied a separate island in the Galapagos chain. On each of
these islands, the finches ate different types of food. On one island, for example, they,,, lived on various
small insects, whereas on another, they ate fruits and nuts. Darwin then made an important connection
between the shape of the finches' beaks and the kind of food they ate. Each beak, he realized, was
suited to each bird's diet. Darwin observed that the finches with long, thin beaks lived in places where
they had to reach between rocks to get insects, while finches with thicker beaks lived on islands where
they used these beaks to inbreak open nuts.
Though Darwin's observations could be considered remarkable in their own right, they are also what
Darwin relied on to help develop his theory of evolution. He realized that the birds had grown beaks
suited to their particular environments because nature had caused these changes over many generations.
Long ago, birds with different types of beaks had probably lived on each island. However, over time, the
population of birds with beaks that were better suited to each island's available food supply had
increased. For example, finches with long, thin beaks did well on islands with many insects, whereas
those with other kinds of beaks on such islands disappeared. Over time, the poorly suited birds had died

such as beak size, become more or less prominent for a species in an environment. "Evolution" refers to
the changes that occur in animal and plant characteristics, and ,n,how those changes lead to further selection.
Darwin's theory is not just for birds, but helps explain the evolution of all plant and animal species,
including humans. In short, an animal with characteristics that are better suited to its environment will
its chances
survival, thus increasing its chances for reproducing. This means that members
a species with biological characteristics better suited to their environment can replace others within
their own species, push aside other species, and even evolve into new species. What happens depends
on the ,S|circumstances. The process itself can take just a few generations or many thousands of years,
but the result is something like what Darwin had observed in the Galapagos Islands.

It is becoming more and more difficult for workers to switch off from work. ( 1 ), many workers answer
or write e-mails on the train to and from work, during lunchtime, and at home after work. ( 2 ), many
people even check their work e-mail when they go on vacation to other countries. ( 3 ), this might be
changing. A German car manufacturer is giving its workers the choice not to receive e-mail when they
are on holiday. This will mean employees will be able to relax on the beach ( 4 ) dealing with work
problems. Employees can choose to automatically remove all work e-mail while on vacation.
Their system is called "Mail on Holiday." The sender gets a reply that says: "I'm using "Mail on
Holiday," so your e-mails will be removed. If you want me to read this e-mail personally, please be kind
enough to send me the information again." Not everyone thinks the system is a good idea, ( 5 ).

U The survival of the human race faces many ( T ). In the short term, the planet we live on is
under threat. If we hope to inhabit Earth for a long time into the future, we must find a way to combat
the immediate problems of global warming and overpopulation. Overcoming these problems will ( -i )
the health of our planet and all the life on it, not just humans. But, even if we manage to do this, life
will eventually no longer be possible here.
It is estimated that the sun, which provides the energy ( ) for life, will last another five billion
years. After that, it will begin to expand, and Earth will become too hot to support life as we know it.
( z. ), if humans want to survive forever, we must find another planet to colonize. Partly with this
reality in mind and partly out of genuine curiosity about the universe, astronomers are searching for
planets outside of our solar system. So far, they have found around 2,000 exoplanets ― planets that
orbit stars other than our own sun.
Finding exoplanets is only part of the challenge since obviously not all planets support life. Scientists
have determined that any planet we hope to colonize must be within the so-called habitable zone around
･ EXtt 2017 :£ll±#AHFp1ffiIEg＼

if
its parent star. The habitable zone is the ( % ) around a star where the temperature is neither too hot
nor too cold.
We are looking for stars that are of similar size to our own sun, and planets that are roughly the same
size as Earth. Astronomers have ( ii ) that there could be 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting Sun-
like stars in our own galaxy alone. In July 2015, they found the best potential candidate yet ― a planet
named Kepler 452b. What makes Kepler 452b so ( ) is that it is nearly the same size as Earth and
orbits its sun at almost the same distance. In fact, a year on Kepler 452b would be only 20 days longer
than an Earth year.
Of course, there are still many questions we need to answer about Kepler 452b. Is it mostly ( 9 ), like
Earth, or is it mostly gas? What is its atmosphere like? Is there liquid water on its surface? But the biggest
question is, "How can we get there?" Whether or not Kepler 452b is capable of supporting ( ), it is
extremely far away, and we don't have the technology to get to it. Located 1,400 light years from Earth,
it would take our most modern space probes more than 20 million years to reach Kepler 452b.
Fortunately, if we can solve our more immediate problems on Earth, we will have a lot of time to continue
exploring the universe and developing the means to ( ^ ) humans even further into space someday.

M) France is known for the long crusty baguette and has more bread bakers than any other , country in
Europe. Yet, sales of pre-cut bread for toast or sandwiches are rising. Last year, sales of Harry's, the
pleading sliced-bread brand, were up by 25% since 2007. Why have sales increased? Mainly because

it stays 3hot longer. Sliced bread can last for days, whereas a freshly baked baguette is best eaten
within hours of coming out of the 4oven. Many women in France today are too ?busy to pick up a
baguette every day because they work full-time. Also, lunchtime habits are changing. Many French
now take as little as 15 minutes to eat lunch, so sandwich consumption is on the 6rise. Another answer
is Harry's "American" sliced bread without crust is heavily advertised on television to children.
(■≫ Wireless charging is a recent technology that allows a wide range of , solar powered machines,
including electric cars, to be 2charged without using any cords. This technology has been used in
South Korea since 2013 to power buses for public transportation and will soon be , tested in the
United Kingdom for electric passenger vehicles. What is special about both of these cases is that the
charging ,, technology is embedded in the roads, so electric vehicles can be charged while driving. One
advantage of this method of charging
made smaller, reducing the
charging is that 5 batteries do not need to store as much power and can be
cost of producing electric vehicles. Also, as they are constantly being
charged while in cmotion, the driving range of electric vehicles is potentially limitless.
(j-) In , strength training, exercises are classified as isolation exercises or compound exercises. Isolation
exercises work one specific muscle. Curling a dumbbell, which only works the bicep ,, muscle, is an
example of an isolation exercise. Compound exercises, on the other hand, use several different
muscles at the same time and are the most effective exercises for increasing strength. A good 3gym
will have both isolation and compound exercises. There are 4 three especially effective compound
exercises. First is the bench press, which works many muscles in the chest, arms, and shoulders. Next,
your workout routine shouldinclude squats. Squats use most leg muscles and also exercise muscles in
the lower back. Finally, the most effective compound exercise is the deadlift. Deadlifts work almost
all 6major muscle groups, including legs, upper and lower back, arms, and shoulders.
W Do cats and dogs have blood types just like humans? Yes, they do, though they are categorized
, differently. Cats have A, B, and AB, but they are not the same as humans'. ,Dogs, on the other
hand, are quite different. They have eight major blood types, labeled as DEA (dog erythrocyte
antigen) 1 to 8. Why is it ,important to know what blood type a person or an animal has? It is
because, when a blood 4test is necessary, a different type of blood may cause a serious and sometimes
fatal reaction. However, unlike humans and most animals, dogs don't have naturally-occurring
antibodies against different blood types, and they can receive any 5type of blood if it is their first
transfusion. Once a different type of blood is given, the recipient dog c develops antibodies against the
donated blood type, so this type of blood shouldn't be used for a second transfusion.

You are on your way to a concert. At an intersection, you encounter a group of people, all staring at
the sky. Without even thinking about @it, you look upwards, too. Why? Social proof. In the middle
of the concert, when the soloist is giving an excellent performance, someone begins to clap and
suddenly ?the whole room joins in. You do, too. Why? Social proof. After the concert you go to the
coat check to pick up your coat. You watch how the people in front of you place a coin on a plate,
even though, officially, the service is included in the ticket price. What do you do? You probably leave
a coin as well. Why? Social proof.
Social proof, sometimes roughly termed the herd instinct, dictates that individuals feel they are
behaving correctly when they act the same as other people. In other words, if a large number of
people follow a certain idea, others will find this idea truer or better. And ^the more people who
display a certain behavior, the more appropriate others will judge it. This is, of course, ridiculous.
Social proof is the evil behind economic bubbles and stock market panic. It exists in fashion,
management techniques, hobbies, religion and diets. In some cases, it can even negatively affect whole
cultures.
A simple experiment carried out in the 1950s by legendary psychologist Solomon Asch shows how
common sense is influenced by peer pressure, the tendency to want to act the same as the members of
one's social group. In Asch's experiment, a research participant is shown a line drawn on paper, and
next to it three lines ― numbered 1, 2 and 3 ― one shorter, one longer and one of the same length as
the original one. The participant must indicate which of the three lines mcorresponds to the original
one. If that participant is alone in the room, he gives correct answers ― unsurprising, because the task
is really quite simple. Now five other people enter the room; they are all actors, a fact that the
participant does not know. One after another, they give wrong answers, saying "number 1," although
it's very clear that number 3 is the correct answer. Then it is the participant's turn again. In one third
of cases, ^,he will answer incorrectly to match the other people's responses.
Why do we act like this? In the past, following others was a good survival strategy. Suppose that
50,000 years ago, you were travelling in the wild with your hunter-gatherer friends, and suddenly they
all fled at the sight of an animal. What would you have done? Would you have remained still,
wondering about what you were looking at? Was it a lion, or something that just looked like a lion but
was in fact a harmless animal? No, you would have followed your friends. Later on, when you were
safe, you could have reflected on what the "lion" had actually been. Those who acted differently from
the group ^did not pass their genes on to the later generations. We are directly descended from those
who copied the others' behavior. This pattern is so deeply rooted in us that we still use it today, even
when it offers no survival advantage, which is most of the time. mOnly a few cases come to mind
where social proof is of value. For example, if you find yourself hungry in a foreign city and don't
know a good restaurant, it makes sense to pick the one that's full of local people. In other words, you
copy the local people's behavior.
Comedy and talk shows make use of social proof by inserting sounds of people laughing at key
7 ･

-74-
moments, encouraging the audience to laugh along. One of the most impressive, though troubling,
cases of this phenomenon is the famous speech by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels,
delivered to a large audience in 1943. As the war went from bad to worse for Germany, he asked the
crowd: "Do you want total war? If necessary, do you want a war more total and radical than anything
that we can even imagine today?" The crowd responded very loudly and enthusiastically, "Yes!" If
the people had been asked individually and anonymously, it is likely that nobody would have
consented to ^this crazy proposal.
The advertising industry benefits greatly from our weakness for social proof. This works well when
^ a situation is unclear ― such as deciding among various car makes, cleaning products, beauty products,
etc. with no obvious advantages or disadvantages ― and where people "like you and me
appear.
So, don't trust a company's advertisement which claims its product is better because it is "the most
popular." mHow is a product better simply because it sells the most units? And remember novelist
W. Somerset Maugham's wise words: "Even if 50 million people say something foolish, it is still

Ned: (1)  You know you are doing better than just "okay." You always get the
highest scores. But why do you work so hard?
Sho: Well, I take school pretty seriously. My parents are Chinese, and they had a hard time when
they first came to Japan.
Ned: You're Chinese? I didn't know that. {2) 
Sho: I'm not from China. My parents are. They are from Shanghai, but I was born and raised in
Japan.
Ned: Really? (3) 
Sho: For me, OK. But my parents had problems at first, because they didn't have much money. Then
they started their own business and began to do well. In my case, I'm more fluent in Japanese
than in my parents' language.
Ned: Oh, but you know Chinese as well, don't you?

Maybe. (4)
I didn't know you were Chinese until you told me so. Maybe that
is why we get along so well. We both have strong connections to two cultures, don't we?
Interesting. {5)  But it's possible. Our experience with different cultures gives

life was governed by a system called "feudalism." In a feudal society,
the king granted large pieces of land to noblemen and bishops. Peasants without land did most of
the work.
B. As a result, more and more people moved to towns and cities. Meanwhile, Christian conquests
had expanded trade routes to the East and given Europeans a taste for imported goods such as
wine, olive oil, and expensive textiles.
C. Thus, urban culture spread and a new era was born: the Renaissance. The Renaissance was a
time of great intellectual and economic change, but it was not a complete change: It had its roots
in the world of the Middle Ages.
D. During the 11th century, however, feudal life began to change. Agricultural innovations such as
the heavy plow and three-field crop rotation made farming productive, so fewer farm workers were
needed ― but thanks to the expanded and improved food supply, the population grew.
E. They planted and harvested crops and gave most of the produce to the landowner. In exchange
for their labor, they were allowed to live on the land. They were also promised protection in case
of enemy invasion.
F. Economic expansion led to port cities becoming larger and larger. Eventually, there were some
15 cities in Europe with a population of more than 50,000.

Six thousand miles from the US lies a country whose flag bears a striking resemblance to the
American one: alternating red and white horizontal stripes and, in the upper left-hand corner, a dark
blue square. Against this blue background is a lone white star ― the star of liberty. The flag is a
symbol of the history of the Liberian state, its relationship with America, and its search for its own
identity.
Liberia is a country of 43,000 square miles in West Africa ( 1 ) on the southwest by the Atlantic
Ocean. From ancient times through the 1700s, many ethnic groups from the surrounding regions
settled in the area, making Liberia one of Africa's most culturally rich and ( 2 ) countries. Settled in
the early 1800s by former slaves and freeborn Blacks from America, Liberia, whose name means
"land of freedom," has always struggled with its double cultural heritage: that of the settlers and that
of the native people.
In 1816, a group of Christians called the Quakers, and slave owners in Washington, D.C., formed the
American Colonization Society (ACS). The Quakers opposed slavery, and the slave owners opposed
the freedom of Blacks, but they agreed on one thing: Black Americans should be sent back to Africa.
The Quakers felt that freeborn Blacks and former slaves would ( 3 ) better chances for freedom in
Africa than in the US. They also saw sending Blacks to Africa as a way of spreading Christianity
through Africa. The slaveholders' motives were less noble: They viewed the sending of Blacks back to
Africa as a way of preventing slaves from rebelling.
Despite opposition from many Blacks and from white people who wanted to end slavery in
America, the program to send Blacks to Africa ( 4 ). In 1822, the first 86 Black Americans landed
on Cape Montserrado. They arrived with white agents of the ACS who would govern them for many
years. Many others followed, settling on land sometimes purchased, sometimes obtained more ( 5 ),
from native chiefs. The first years were a challenge: The settlers suffered from malaria and yellow
fever, which were common diseases in the area's coastal plains, and from attacks by the native
populations. The natives were unhappy with the ( 6 ) of the settlements along the coast, with the
settlers' efforts to put an end to the profitable slave trading in which some ethnic groups were engaged,
and with the settlers' attempts to spread Christianity in their communities. Despite these difficulties,
the Black settlers were ( 7 ) to show the world that they could create, develop, and run their own
country. And so they kept arriving.
In 1824, the area became known as Liberia. Over the next 40 years, 19,000 African Americans
settled in Liberia, along with some 5,000 Africans saved from slave ships, and a small number of West
Indian immigrants. The settlers recreated American society, building churches and homes that ( 8 )
Southern US plantations. And they continued to speak English. They also entered into a complex
relationship with the native people ― marrying them in some cases, discriminating against them in
others, but all the time attempting to westernize the traditional communities. After Liberia declared
its independence in 1847, Joseph J. Roberts, a freeborn Black from America was ( 9 ) Liberia's first
president. It had taken fewer than 25 years for the Blacks from America to begin to govern their own,

HB*(2J13H3tJfe)
free country. Roberts and his senators, all American-born, resolved to create a country ( 10 ) the
principles of justice and equal rights.
The settlers built schools and a university, and during the early years, agriculture, shipbuilding, and
trade greatly developed. Yet, as Liberia expanded its borders, a government of Blacks from America
located largely on the coast attempted to establish control over a growing native population located
largely in the interior. Over the next few decades, growing economic difficulties began to weaken the
state's ( 11 ) over the coastal native population. When the financially burdened ACS withdrew its
support, conditions worsened as Liberia tried to modernize its largely agricultural economy. The cost
of imports was far greater than the income ( 12 ) by exports of coffee, rice, palm oil, and timber.
Liberia was also struggling under the burden of heavy loans, primarily from Britain. By 1909, the
government had no money left and was forced to borrow further from the US.
To bring in more income, the Liberian state leased large areas of land to private American
companies. The terms of the leases were strongly in favor of the companies. In 1930, the League of
Nations ( 13 ) these companies of engaging in "forced labor," which turned out to be true. The
government collapsed, and the new president dealt with the increasing frustration among his people by
( 14 ) harsh laws.
Despite its political, economic, and social troubles, Liberia, as the only free country in Africa, was a
model for other African countries struggling to achieve independence. William V. S. Tubman, president
since 1944, further highlighted the country's world profile by traveling abroad and allowing international
investment in Liberia. With this investment and the income from newly discovered mineral deposits,
he modernized parts of Liberia and built schools, roads, and hospitals. Tubman also expanded the
incorporation of local populations into the social and economic mainstream, ( 15 ) them, for example,
the right to vote. Under Tubman, Liberia was a founding member of the United Nations as well as of
the Organization of African Unity, and he supported the independence of other African states.

Climate change isn't new. Our planet is always changing and its environment rarely stays still for
long. There have been times in the distant past when levels of CO2 were much higher than they are
today, and Antarctica, a continent around the South Pole, was a tropical paradise. There have been
others when CO2 levels were much lower, and there was even ice in what are now tropical areas. But
over the past ten thousand years the Earth's climate has been unusually steady. We humans have
become used to a world where the temperature hasn't changed much. In other words, we have been
lucky. Now our steady reliable climate is changing, and this time nature isn't to blame. But how do
we know for certain that the world is warming?
When you're trying to determine whether the world's temperature is rising, the biggest problem is
^picking out a signal from the "background noise." Even in our relatively stable times, temperatures
move up and down from one day to another, from season to season, from year to year, and from place
to place. To be sure that the trend is occurring, you need to take precise measurements from many
different places around the world, and do so for an extremely long time. The world's longest survey is
the Central England Temperature Record, which is a result of the serious data-collecting habits of
seventeenth-century British natural scientists. It covers a large region of England and stretches back to
1659. ^The impressive record shows clear signs of warming, especially toward the end of the
twentieth century.
However, the record covers only a tiny part of the globe. Changes in England don't necessarily
reflect changes in the United States or Brazil. It also doesn't go back far enough to reveal just how
unusual our recent warm temperatures really are. How do they compare, for instance, to @the
apparent warm period in medieval times when grapes were grown in northern England? Or to the so-
called Little Ice Age several hundred years ago, when the River Thames in London froze over
completely so that people could gather and sell things on its solid surface? To answer these questions,
scientists have ^ come up with clever ways to expand the records geographically and extend them
backward in time. These records are written not by humans, but by nature.
Every year, the average tree grows a ring of new wood around its trunk. In a good year the ring will
be thicker, in a bad year, thinner. Researchers drill a small core into the side of the tree, about the size
of a wine cork, take out the wood, and then count and measure. By examining trees that are different
ages, cthey have been able to create a temperature record extending more than a thousand years and
from regions across northern Europe, Russia, and North America.
In the frozen north and south, ice also contains a record book of past climate. ^Each year's snowfall
buries the previous one. If temperatures are cold enough, the snow stays around long enough to be
squeezed into ice, clearly marking out the annual layers because summer's snow crystals are larger
than winter's, or because more dust blows in each year with the winter winds. The amount of snow
that fell in a given year gives clues as to how warm it was then.
By ^fitting together a variety of measures like these, researchers have come to remarkably similar
conclusions about temperatures over the last thousand years. The eleventh century was indeed
relatively warm, corresponding to the Medieval Warm Period. Temperatures were cooler in the
seventeenth century, corresponding to the Little Ice Age, and again in the early nineteenth century.
These warm and cool periods apparently were also fairly widespread.
However, it was only in the twentieth century that temperatures really began to rise noticeably. The
warming didn't happen regularly, but in two bursts ― which turns out to be important. The first one
occurred during the early years of the century and was marked enough that it made itself clearly felt.
The second burst of
ever since. And,
crucially, the temperatures we are
egan in the 1970s and has been gath<
experiencing now are hotter than they
the entire last
thousand years. Even the Medieval Warm Period was cooler than it is today.
Let's look at some numbers. On a global scale, from the 1910s to the 1940s, average temperatures
rose by about 0.3 °C. After that there was a cooling of about 0.1 °C, and since 1970 the world has
warmed by a further 0.6 °C. These numbers might not sound like much, but they are very significant.

HB*(2/S3B&Jfc)
Although the temperature where you live can change by much more than this within the space of a
few hours or days, it is much more worrying when global annual averages show a clear upward trend.
Averaging in this way ^smooths out short-term differences and shows what's really happening. That's
why a small change in global average temperature can reflect a very big shift in climate. Speaking in
global averages, ^.only a few degrees separate us from the frozen world of the last ice age.

Taro is an exchange student at an American university. He is talking with John after class.
Taro: Hey, John. Can you help me with something?
John: Sure,
Taro: Yeste
at my apartment I received a notice saying not to hang my laundry out on the
balcony. I can't understand why!
John: Well, the owner might be worried that the buUding will look messy if people hang their clothes
outside. Do people hang them out like that in Japan?
Taro: Yes, of course. (2)  In fact, the weather programs on TV even tell people
which days will be good for drying.
John: That's interesting. I've never seen such a thing on television here.
Taro: (3)  If I'm not allowed to hang my laundry on the balcony when it's sunny,
how can I get it dry?
John: Around here, most people use a clothes dryer. There must be one in the basement of your
apartment.
Taro: Yes, but dryers are bad for the clothing. And they waste electricity.
John: (4)  But most Americans find dryers to be much easier and quicker than
natural drying.
Taro: I see, but I really don't like to share the dryers in the basement with other people. I'm afraid
that those dryers are dirty.
John: Well then, you may have to buy one of your own. If you check the advertisements on the
Internet, maybe you can find a cheap used one.

A. A growing body of research suggests that excessive social media use can have negative effects on
the mental health of people of all ages.
B. Not all researchers agree with this, however. Some argue that people who are lonely to begin
with, or shy, are more likely to spend long hours on Facebook. So loneliness is not the fault of
social media. In any case, widespread usage of social media is a twenty-first century phenomenon,
so we are still learning to understand and cope with it.
C. Adults may also become depressed when using Facebook but for a different reason. Findings by
the University of Michigan suggest that the more time adults spend using Facebook, the lonelier
they become.
D. A recent study of American teenagers found that 22 percent of them log onto social media sites
at least ten times a day. Many of them reported being subject to bullying or unwelcome sexual
comments online, causing what researchers described as "Facebook depression."
E. Adults' Facebook depression occurs, for example, when people sit alone looking at countless
photos of friends having fun or doing something interesting. They may negatively compare their
own lives to what they see on their screens.
F. Other research shows that the superficial nature of online friendships can also contribute to
feelings of loneliness. The greater the proportion of face-to-face interaction in people's lives, the
less lonely they feel.

A researcher at the University of California at Berkeley recently made a study of the nation's
walking habits and found that the average person in the United States walks less than 120 kilometers a
year ― about 2 kilometers a week, about 300 meters a day. I'm no stranger to being lazy myself, but
that's surprisingly little. I walk more kilometers just looking for the remote control for my TV.
Eighty-five percent of Americans, according to the Berkeley study, are essentially sedentary ― we
rarely get up from our seats and move around ― and 35 percent are totally sedentary. We have
become a nation of ( 1 ).
One of the things my wife and I wanted when we decided to move back to America from England
was to live in a manageably sized town ( 2 ) walking distance of a central business district. Hanover,
where we settled, is a typical small town in the Northeast United States, pleasant, calm, and compact.
It has a broad central square surrounded by the old and respected buildings of Dartmouth College, a
narrow Main Street, and green residential streets. It is, in short, an agreeable, easy place to go about
one's business on foot, and yet as far as I can tell almost no one does.
I ( 3 ) to the center of the town nearly every day when I am at home. I go to the post office or
library or bookstore, and sometimes, if I feel like it, I stop at Rosey Jekes Cafe for a cappuccino.
( 4 ) in the evenings my wife and I stroll up to the Nugget Theater for a movie or to a bar for a beer.
All this is a big part of my life and I wouldn't dream of doing it other than on foot. People have
gotten used to this unusual behavior now, but several times in the early days, acquaintances who were
passing by would slow down by the sidewalk and ask if I wanted a ride.
"But I'm going your way," they would ( 5 ) when I politely declined. "Really, it's no bother," I
would reply. "Well, if you're absolutely sure," they would say and depart reluctantly, even guiltily.
People have become so ( 6 ) using the car for everything that it would never occur to them to use
their legs and see what those lower limbs can do. It is worth mentioning that 93 percent of all trips
outside the property in the United States now involve the use of a car.
As with most old Northeastern towns designed for another age of transportation, Hanover ( 7 ) a
particularly friendly place for cars. Nearly any visit to town by automobile will be characterized by a
long and very annoying hunt for a parking space. To improve this, the local authorities are widening
roads to speed traffic flow and building new parking lots ― Dartmouth recently ( 8 ) an old hospital
building in order to insert more parking space into the heart of the campus ― failing to understand
that it is the absence of these features that makes the town desirable in the first place.
But it isn't really the authorities who are to blame. It is the people who wish to take two tons of
metal with them ( 9 ) they go. We have reached an age where college students expect to drive
between classes, where parents will get in a car and drive three blocks to pick up their children from a
friend's house, where the postman takes his van up and down every driveway on a street. We will
( 10 ) to great extents to save ourselves twenty feet of walking.
Sometimes it's almost ridiculous. The other day I was in the little nearby town of Etna waiting to
bring home one of my children from a piano lesson. A car stopped outside the local post office and a
HXtt 2017 ^H^AHfaaiEfS ･

man about my age ( 11 ) and dashed inside and left the engine running. He was inside for about three
or four minutes, then came out, got in the car, and drove exactly sixteen feet to the general store next
door, and rushed in again, engine still running.
And the thing is, this man looked really fit. I'm sure he jogs great distances and plays sports and
does all kinds of very ( 12 ) things, but I am just as sure that he drives to each of those undertakings.
It's ( 13 ). An acquaintance of ours was complaining how difficult it was to find a place to park
outside the local gym. She goes there several times a week to walk on a running machine. The gym
is, at most, a six-minute walk from her front door. I asked her why she didn't walk to the gym and do
six minutes less on the machine. She looked at me as if I were ( 14 ) simple-minded and said, "But I
have a program for the running machine. It records my distance and speed and calorie-burn rate, and I
can adjust it for degree of difficulty." Her logic does not make any sense to me.
According to a recent editorial in a newspaper, the United States spends less than 1 percent of its
$25 billion-a-year highway budget on facilities for pedestrians. Actually, I'm surprised it's ( 15 ). Go
to almost any suburb developed in the last thirty years and you will not find a sidewalk anywhere.
Often you won't find a single pedestrian crossing. The fact is, we not only don't walk anywhere
anymore in this country, we won't walk anywhere. And if that isn't sad, I don't know what is.

Social researchers have long been interested in philosophical questions about the nature of
happiness, and whether or not people truly understand what will make them happy. Recently, some of
them have expressed concerns that people are focusing too much on achieving a state of happiness for
themselves and their families, and that they are impatient to reach this goal. In fact, a growing number
of experts now believe that the way some members of modern society are approaching the pursuit of
pleasure actually makes them feel miserable.
In the Western world, there is a very long tradition of "self-help." People try to improve themselves
emotionally, intellectually, or financially by means of conscious thought and behavioral change. cSelf:
help theories became more prominent during the twentieth century as the average person gained more
time for leisure, including reading. It was in the 1980s, however, that the self-help movement really
boomed. This came in response to rising rates of depression in Western society, arising from a difficult
period of social, economic and technological change.
Despite
Australian
intentions that
movement, critics, such as
researcher Hugh Mackay, believe it has started to harm society. He feels that it has
"become an industry, " because it has been taken over by public speakers and writers who present
unrealistic views of life, and try to sell happiness as a commodity. According to Mackay, the dominant
idea that is being sold is that people should always be bright, happy, and optimistic, because that is
their natural condition. As a result, it is ^increasingly common for people to think that if they are not
happy, there must be something mentally wrong with them. In the opinion of Russ Harris, a doctor
and author, these days "we refuse to accept that we can't always get what we want." In his recent
book The Happiness Trap, Harris argues that currently popular ideas about happiness are confusing
and are likely to make people miserable. Some doctors believe that current ideas about happiness are
partly f:, to blame for rising rates of heavy drinking, drug use, and obesity. The more we fail to find
genuine contentment, the more we seek to fill the gap with unhealthy behaviors that make us feel
good for a short time. But as we try to get rid of our feelings of sadness, failure and disappointment,
our rates of depression and anxiety continue to rise.
Along with the spread of the "feel-good, think positive" attitude encouraged by the modern self-
help industry, experts also note that a related "self-esteem movement" has appeared. According to
this outlook, the most important thing that parents can do for their children is to give them self-
esteem, or confidence in themselves. Therefore, parents are being urged by the "happiness industry"
of life coaches to praise their children at every opportunity in order to make them feel clever and
special.
Some of the world's leading happiness specialists now fear that ^,the self-esteem movement will
leave future generations hopelessly unprepared to deal with life's disappointments. Researchers are
concerned that many parents are raising children who, rather than learning the value of hard work, are
acquiring the belief that if they want something desperately enough they can have it. Carol Dweck,
professor of psychology at Stanford University, is troubled by the fact that parents are unwilling to let
their children struggle. Her research, based on observations of how children react when trying to solve
difficult problems, suggests that providing a lot of person praise (such as "you're talented, you're
special") only makes children worried. The pressure to merit all the praise they have been given
causes them to get upset, or lie about their performance. However, when given process praise (such as
"you focused well, you tried hard, you used good strategies") children enjoy trying difficult problems,
where they can apply their effort and strategies and show a strong spirit. Professor Dweck ^urges
parents to talk to their children not just about their victories but their struggles. Like Harris, she
maintains that accepting disappointments and unpleasant emotions, rather than trying to block them
out, is the key to building personal strength.
Already, mental health professionals are seeing the first victims of the self-esteem movement
entering therapy. In 2011, American therapist Lori Gottlieb reported that many young adults ―
largely from happy, loving, advantaged homes ― were feeling confused, anxious and empty due to
overprotective parenting that focused too much on happiness and protected them from difficulties.
After entering ^ the real world, even minor obstacles became disasters for these young people.
The fact that some young people are dealing with ^issues like this inspired Hugh Mackay to write
that we must look beyond the pursuit of success and happiness as life's main goals. According to
Mackay, what is most important is developing our relationships with other people and our
responsibility for other people's well-being. Doing so supports the growth of communities, which are
essential to sustain us through our lives. If we focus only on happiness, we're neglecting the richness
of ^the full range of emotions. In fact, without knowing sadness, we couldn't appreciate happiness.

Huntley High School in Huntley, Chicago, Illinois, offers a blended
learning program. It allows
students to combine online learning with in-person teacher instruction.
Most days, 16-year-old Jason Zobott walks into Huntley High School in suburban Chicago around
7:30 a.m. like any high schooler might. (5)It's what he does the rest of the day that's not so typical.
Zobott is ,C1 enrolled in Huntley High's blended learning program, which merges Internet-based
instruction with a more traditional classroom setting. One-third of the school's 2,700 students are
enrolled. In 2015, the school is working toward enrolling the majority of its students.
"Having to work online makes ( 7 ) really accessible to do the work that I have to get done," said
Zobott, a top-ranked junior who balances a heavy load of extracurricular activities ( 8 ) schoolwork.
"I can learn on my own. I can work at the pace I want to work. And I learn the way I want to learn."
Huntley High School students and educators often refer to the program simply as "blended." It allows
teachers to write the curriculum, ( 9 ) about the focus. Unlike many traditional online learning
programs, students have the option of a flexible schedule during allotted blended learning days. Some
days they meet with teachers, and some days they work online, according to Anne Pasco, who heads the
school's educational technology efforts.
"In blended learning, we focus on the content. We don't focus on needing to cover X amount of
material," Pasco said. "Blended allows us to provide a stable environment that gives students the ability
to spread their wings a bit, while we have the safety net of pulling them back into class if they need it."
The "homegrown" program, which ,,nilaunched in 2011, gives students who struggle in certain content
areas more one-on-one time with teachers during the school day, Pasco said.
"Before blended, (11)that had to happen after school or before school or on Saturday or maybe not at
all, because we had too many other activities that encroach upon students' academic day," Pasco said.
"Now, this student can work one-on-one with that teacher during the school day."
Teachers can monitor students' progress and track lesson plans online to see how much time students
spend on a specific assignment. Teachers are allowed to restructure the class schedule based on students'
needs.
"There's actually much better accountability," said John Burkey, the superintendent for Huntley
High's school district, which includes about 9,500 students.
"Blended learning is not a panacea, and the success of the program isn't about spending a bunch of
money on technology. Rather, it's looking at what students actually need, and building a culture of
innovation to ( 12 ) those needs."
Burkey said there were plenty of questions about blended learning when it was first introduced to the
Chicago district in 2011. One concern: How was the district going to pay for it?
It turns out the blended learning program spends about $8,500 per student, less than the Illinois
average of $12,000 per student.
"We spend considerably less than the average school district. We don't have a lot of resources
compared to many districts," Burkey said.
"We did not put new money into this. What we did is change the old things we were doing and
changed them into new ways. It's really a change in how you think of high school. This is not a more
expensive option."
It has worked. In a study published in 2014 in eLearn magazine, 92% of students surveyed at Huntley
High said that they were satisfied with the blended learning experience, and Mno teachers reported
negative experiences with it. The school is also seeing higher standardized testing scores.

"The growth of blended certainly has corresponded with an overall rise in ACT scores," district
spokesman Dan Armstrong said. Since blended learning was implemented, Huntley High's average
composite ACT score has gone up nearly a point, from 22.1 to 23.0.
For 16-year-old Zobott, the advantage is time management. Three of his courses are advanced
placement. He also plays varsity basketball and club soccer and works part time. ,iaThe blended
learning program helps him better prioritize his busy schedule.
"Having blended gives us time to work on them, and get stuff done efficiently so we have more time
during the week to do other things," he said.
"What's still left to be determined about blended learning is how well students do in college or jobs
after they graduate," Burkey said.
"I think we're still in the infancy of this," Burkey said. "It's still such a new thing, and we're all
excited about it. My own kids are still in elementary and middle school, so they have not done blended
learning yet, but they definitely will when they get to high school."
